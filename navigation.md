## **Navigating The Threads: A Basic Practice**

The act of naming tensions is itself the beginning of navigation. When communities can identify and share language for universal tensions, they've already started crossing the bridge. What follows is one simple practice for engaging these tensions - not THE way, but A way that has proven useful.

### **The Navigation Practice**

When you encounter a tension:

1. **Identify** - Which thread/tension is present? Naming it reduces its unconscious power.
2. **Locate** - Where do you feel it in your body? Tension lives in flesh before thought.
3. **Breathe** - Stay present to both/all poles. Don't choose sides yet.
4. **Listen** - What is the tension teaching? What needs does it reveal in yourself and others?
5. **Choose** - Make a conscious choice, including the choice to wait.
6. **Learn** - What emerged from holding the tension rather than resolving it?

### **The Intentional Incompleteness**

This practice is deliberately simple and incomplete. Why? Because:

- Each tradition has its own wisdom for engaging paradox
- Communities need room to develop their contextual practices
- What works for one tension might not work for another
- The framework succeeds by being adapted, not adopted wholesale

**The deepest navigation might be simply this:** When we identify tensions together, listen to what they reveal about our different needs, and stay present to both/all truths, we're already navigating. The rest is commentary.

### **Your Navigation Practice**

We invite you to:
- Try this basic practice and see what works
- Develop your own navigation methods
- Share what you learn with the community
- Remember: even struggling with these tensions IS navigating them

**Sometimes the most profound navigation is just staying in the boat together while the waters churn.**

This framing:
- Provides concrete practice without claiming it's definitive
- Honors that naming itself is navigation
- Makes incompleteness a feature, not bug
- Invites innovation rather than mere implementation
- Stays humble about what "navigation" even means
