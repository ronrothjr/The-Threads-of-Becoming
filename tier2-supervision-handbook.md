Part One: Supervision Overview
Purpose and Philosophy
Supervision is where knowledge becomes skill. The 6 hours of required supervision across the Tier 2 training period serve several essential functions:
Quality Assurance: Ensuring candidates can actually apply what they've learned
Skill Development: Providing feedback that accelerates growth
Safety: Catching problematic patterns before they become habits
Community: Building peer relationships that support ongoing practice
Modeling: Demonstrating how to hold tension in a learning context

The supervision relationship itself models the framework. Supervisors hold the tension between supporting candidates and maintaining standards—between encouragement and honest feedback.
Supervision Structure
Practitioner candidates complete 6 hours of supervision across three sessions:

Session
Timing
Focus
Session 1 (2 hrs)
After Week 2
Practice recording review; Diagnostic accuracy feedback
Session 2 (2 hrs)
After Week 3
Collapse recognition and correction feedback
Session 3 (2 hrs)
After Week 4
Dyadic practice review; Readiness assessment


Supervision is conducted in small groups of 3-4 candidates with a Certified Threads Facilitator (CTF).
Supervisor Qualifications
Supervision must be conducted by a Certified Threads Facilitator (CTF) who has:
Completed Tier 3 Facilitator training
Maintained active certification status
Completed supervision-specific training (Tier 3, Module 5)
Demonstrated competency in providing constructive feedback

Part Two: Session Guides for Supervisors
Session 1: Diagnostic Accuracy
Timing: After Week 2 (following the Diagnostic Accuracy module)
Duration: 2 hours
Focus: Review of practice recordings; feedback on thread identification

Session Agenda
Opening (15 min): Check-in, review session purpose, establish feedback agreements
Individual Recording Review (75 min): For each candidate: context, play segment, self-reflect, peer observations, supervisor feedback, action item
Group Learning (20 min): Common patterns, frequent diagnostic pitfalls, Q&A
Closing (10 min): Practice focus for next week, preview Session 2

What to Look For
Signs of Developing Competency
Signs Needing Attention
Uses diagnostic questions fluidly
Articulates both poles clearly
Distinguishes primary from secondary threads
Shows curiosity rather than certainty
Imposes thread rather than discovers it
Conflates poles within a thread
Confuses threads with similar language
Rushes to diagnosis without exploration


Session 2: Collapse Recognition & Correction
Timing: After Week 3 (following the Collapse & Emergence module)
Duration: 2 hours
Focus: Identifying collapse in real-time; applying correction moves

Session Agenda
Opening (15 min): Check-in on collapse challenges, review Session 1 action items
Individual Recording Review (75 min): Play collapse segment, 'freeze frame' exercise, debrief, practice alternative corrections
Group Learning (20 min): Collapse patterns by thread, correction move repertoire
Closing (10 min): Identify 'collapse blind spots', preview dyadic work

What to Look For
Signs of Developing Competency
Signs Needing Attention
Notices collapse as it happens
Redirects gently, not harshly
Names the unchosen pole with compassion
Recognizes emergence and supports it
Misses collapse entirely
Joins the collapse (agrees with one pole)
Corrects in ways that feel like criticism
Forces resolution instead of allowing emergence


Session 3: Dyadic Practice & Readiness Assessment
Timing: After Week 4 (following the Dyadic Application & Ethics module)
Duration: 2 hours
Focus: Dyadic work review; final readiness assessment for certification

Session Agenda
Opening (10 min): Check-in on dyadic shift, frame readiness assessment
Dyadic Recording Review (60 min): Play segments, focus on neutrality and shared thread naming
Individual Readiness Conversations (30 min): Private 8-10 min with each candidate
Closing (20 min): Group reflection, community of practice info, closing ritual

Readiness Assessment Criteria
Candidates must 'Meet Standard' on all five competencies:

Competency
Meets Standard
Does Not Yet Meet
Protocol Fidelity
Follows 4-phase arc; uses appropriate scripts; maintains timing
Skips phases; uses scripts rigidly or not at all; loses structure
Diagnostic Accuracy
Correctly identifies primary thread; articulates both poles
Misidentifies thread; conflates poles; imposes rather than discovers
Collapse Correction
Recognizes collapse; applies gentle redirect; honors unchosen pole
Misses collapse; corrects harshly; joins the collapse
Emergence Support
Notices emergence signs; supports without forcing; honors partial shifts
Misses emergence; forces resolution; overreaches on outcomes
Facilitator Presence
Stays grounded; holds space; manages own activation
Gets activated; tries to solve; loses neutrality


Part Three: Candidate Materials
Practice Recording Guidelines
Practice recordings are essential to your development. These guidelines ensure your recordings are useful for supervision.

What to Record
Session 1 (after Week 2): One complete Navigation Conversation (15-25 min). Focus: Demonstrate your diagnostic process.
Session 2 (after Week 3): One Navigation Conversation showing collapse and your response. Note the timestamp where collapse occurs.
Session 3 (after Week 4): One dyadic Navigation Conversation (two parties + you as practitioner). Focus: Demonstrate neutrality.

Technical Requirements
Audio quality: Clear enough to understand all speakers
Format: MP3, M4A, or video file (MP4, MOV)
Length: 15-30 minutes (do not edit or trim)
Naming: [YourName]_Session[#]_[Date].mp3

Consent Requirements
All recordings must include informed consent. Have participants sign the Recording Consent Form or give verbal consent on recording.

Recording Consent Form

Self-Reflection Prompts
Submit these reflections with each recording. Honest self-assessment accelerates your learning.

Session 1 Self-Reflection (Diagnostic Accuracy)
Which thread did you identify as primary? What led you to this diagnosis?
 
 
Were there moments you considered a different thread? What made you rule it out?
 
 
How confident are you in your diagnosis? (1-10)
 
 

Session 2 Self-Reflection (Collapse & Correction)
At what timestamp(s) did collapse occur? How did you recognize it?
 
 
What correction move did you attempt? How did it land?
 
 
Did you notice any emergence? What did you do to support it?
 
 

Session 3 Self-Reflection (Dyadic Practice)
How did you maintain neutrality between the two parties?
 
 
What shared thread did you identify? How did you name it to both parties?
 
 
How ready do you feel to work with individuals and dyads professionally?
 
 

Part Four: Feedback Forms
These forms are designed to be fillable. Circle ratings, then add narrative notes.

Part Six: Extended Engagement Pathway
When a candidate does not yet meet standard in one or more competencies, this is not failure—it is information. The Extended Engagement Pathway provides structured support.

Key principle: Extended engagement is about growth, not remediation. We approach candidates with the same stance we teach them to hold with clients.
When Candidates Are Not Yet Ready
A candidate may be assessed as 'not yet ready' when:
They do not meet standard on one or more of the five core competencies
There are concerns about judgment, ethics, or self-awareness
They need more practice before working independently
Extended Engagement Options
1. Targeted Practice Assignment
For: Candidates with specific skill gaps
Format: 2-4 additional practice recordings + review

2. Extended Supervision
For: Candidates who need more feedback and coaching
Format: 1-2 additional supervision sessions (2-4 hours)

3. Peer Practice Partnership
For: Candidates who would benefit from structured practice with feedback
Format: 4-6 practice sessions with another candidate or certified practitioner

4. Module Re-Engagement
For: Candidates with significant conceptual gaps
Format: Attend specific module(s) with a subsequent cohort

5. Personal Work Recommendation
For: Candidates whose own unresolved tensions are interfering
Format: Referral for personal therapy, coaching, or Navigation Conversations
Re-Assessment Process
After completing the Extended Engagement Plan:
Candidate submits: New practice recording demonstrating the competencies in question
Supervisor reviews: Recording with focus on previously identified gaps
Re-Assessment Session: 30-60 minute individual session to discuss progress
Decision: Ready for certification OR additional engagement needed

There is no limit to re-assessment attempts. The goal is competent practitioners, not fast certification.

Closing

"Supervision is not surveillance.
It is the continuation of the same work—
holding the tension between what is and what could be,
in service of emergence."
