# **How to Use This Toolkit**

The Threads toolkit is modular by design. You don't need to read everything—you need the right documents for your context. This guide helps you find them.

## **Toolkit Architecture**

Think of the toolkit as four concentric circles:

1. **Core Concepts** (Blog Article, Cheat Sheet, Visual Maps) — What the framework IS  
2. **Personal Application** (Workbook, Reflection Tool) — Using it on YOURSELF  
3. **Facilitation** (Facilitator Guide, Protocol Cards, Case Studies) — Using it with OTHERS  
4. **Specialized Contexts** (Clinical Guide, Org Guide, Field Front Doors) — Adapting to SPECIFIC settings

**Golden Rule:** Never hand someone a document from circle 3 or 4 without ensuring they have access to circles 1 and 2\. The framework must be understood and personally experienced before it can be facilitated.
