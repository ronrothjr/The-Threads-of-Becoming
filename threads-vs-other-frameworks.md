# Threads of Becoming vs. Other Frameworks
**A Guide to Understanding When to Use What**

---

## Overview

Threads of Becoming is not intended to replace other valuable frameworks. Instead, it provides a **diagnostic layer** that helps you identify which frameworks to use when.

Think of it as a **navigation system** that sits beneath your existing practices, helping you recognize patterns before you intervene.

## Quick Comparison Matrix

| Framework | Primary Focus | Best For | When to Use Threads Instead | Use Both When |
|-----------|--------------|----------|----------------------------|---------------|
| **Polarity Management** | Mapping interdependent pairs | Understanding specific polarities | You need to *identify which polarity* you're in first | Mapping a specific thread after diagnosis |
| **Nonviolent Communication (NVC)** | Individual needs & empathy | Interpersonal conflict, communication skills | Systemic/organizational tensions (not just person-to-person) | Individual conflicts reveal thread collapse patterns |
| **Internal Family Systems (IFS)** | Inner psychological parts | Individual therapy, self-work | Team/organizational dynamics | Leaders' internal parts are collapsing into organizational threads |
| **Agile/Scrum** | Iterative development, delivery | Software teams, product development | Team is oscillating between planning and execution (PAUSE collapse) | Sprint retrospectives to name thread patterns |
| **OKRs (Objectives & Key Results)** | Goal-setting, alignment | Strategic planning, performance management | Goals conflict because underlying threads are in collapse | Setting OKRs that honor both poles of a thread |
| **Design Thinking** | Human-centered problem solving | Innovation, product design | The "problem" is actually a tension to navigate, not solve | Prototyping solutions that hold both poles |
| **Theory U** | Presencing, emergence | Deep change, transformational leadership | Need diagnostic clarity before presencing | Threads help name what wants to emerge |
| **Crucial Conversations** | High-stakes dialogue skills | Difficult conversations, conflict | Need to understand *which thread* is driving the conflict | Having crucial conversations *about* thread navigation |

## Detailed Comparisons

### **Threads vs. Polarity Management**

**What is Polarity Management?**
Barry Johnson's framework for mapping interdependent pairs (e.g., centralization ↔ decentralization) and managing them over time.

**How Threads is Different:**
- **Diagnostic first:** Threads helps you *identify which polarity you're in* before you start mapping
- **Universal patterns:** Seven archetypal threads that appear across all contexts
- **Scalability:** Maps individual, team, and organizational simultaneously
- **Embodied integration:** Includes somatic practices for navigation

**When to Use Polarity Management:**
- You've already identified a specific polarity and want to map it in detail
- You need a structured ongoing management plan for a known tension
- Your organization is familiar with polarity thinking

**When to Use Threads:**
- You don't know which polarity is driving your organizational tension
- You have multiple tensions and need to identify the primary one
- You want a framework that scales from individual to organizational

**Use Both:**
Many organizations use Threads for diagnosis, then apply Polarity Management to specific threads. Example:
1. Thread assessment identifies CONSENT (Self ↔ Other) as primary tension
2. Polarity mapping of "Centralized Control ↔ Distributed Autonomy"
3. Ongoing polarity management with Threads language

### **Threads vs. Nonviolent Communication (NVC)**

**What is NVC?**
Marshall Rosenberg's framework for empathetic communication focused on observations, feelings, needs, and requests.

**How Threads is Different:**
- **Organizational vs. interpersonal:** Threads addresses systemic patterns, not just individual communication
- **Pattern recognition:** NVC focuses on skills; Threads focuses on diagnosis
- **Complexity:** Threads integrates multiple scales (individual, team, organizational)

**When to Use NVC:**
- Interpersonal conflicts between individuals
- Teaching communication skills
- Mediation and dialogue facilitation

**When to Use Threads:**
- The conflict is systemic (shows up across teams, not just between two people)
- Communication skills aren't the issue—structural tensions are
- You need to name organizational collapse patterns

**Use Both:**
- Individual conflicts (use NVC) often reveal thread collapses (use Threads to address systemic pattern)
- Example: Two leaders have needs conflict → reveals CONSENT thread collapse at organizational level

---

### **Threads vs. Internal Family Systems (IFS)**

**What is IFS?**
Richard Schwartz's therapy model focused on internal "parts" (manager, firefighter, exile) and accessing "Self" energy.

**How Threads is Different:**
- **External vs. internal:** Threads maps organizational/relational tensions; IFS maps internal psychological parts
- **Collective patterns:** Threads works at team/org level; IFS is individual therapeutic work

**When to Use IFS:**
- Individual therapy or coaching
- Leader's internal conflicts (parts pulling in different directions)
- Trauma healing, self-leadership

**When to Use Threads:**
- Team or organizational tensions
- Multiple people experiencing the same collapse pattern
- Need systemic intervention, not individual therapy

**Use Both:**
- Leaders' internal parts often mirror organizational threads
- Example: Leader's "manager part" (control) vs. "exile part" (trust) reflects organizational CONSENT collapse
- IFS for personal work; Threads for organizational application

---

### **Threads vs. Agile/Scrum**

**What is Agile/Scrum?**
Iterative software development methodology focused on sprints, retrospectives, and adaptive planning.

**How Threads is Different:**
- **Framework vs. diagnostic:** Agile is a process; Threads helps diagnose why the process is struggling
- **Pattern naming:** Threads explains *why* teams oscillate between over-planning and rushing

**When to Use Agile:**
- Software development, product teams
- Need structured delivery process
- Want iterative feedback loops

**When to Use Threads:**
- Agile isn't working (team is stuck or oscillating)
- Retrospectives surface the same conflicts repeatedly
- Need to understand *why* sprint planning fails

**Use Both:**
- Use Threads to diagnose collapse patterns in Agile teams
- Example: Team oscillates between detailed sprint planning (PAUSE: Not Yet) and reactive firefighting (PAUSE: Now)
- Apply thread navigation to stabilize Agile practice

---

### **Threads vs. OKRs (Objectives & Key Results)**

**What are OKRs?**
Goal-setting framework popularized by Google, focused on ambitious objectives and measurable key results.

**How Threads is Different:**
- **Diagnosis vs. execution:** OKRs set goals; Threads helps when goals conflict
- **Pattern recognition:** Threads explains why OKRs feel impossible to achieve

**When to Use OKRs:**
- Strategic planning, alignment
- Performance management
- Clear goals with measurable outcomes

**When to Use Threads:**
- OKRs conflict with each other (e.g., "Increase innovation" vs. "Reduce risk")
- Teams can't agree on priorities
- Goals require navigating inherent tensions

**Use Both:**
- Set OKRs that honor both poles of a thread
- Example: PAUSE thread → OKR: "Reduce decision-making time by 30% *while* maintaining quality standards"
- Use Threads to identify which tensions need navigation before setting OKRs

---

### **Threads vs. Design Thinking**

**What is Design Thinking?**
Human-centered innovation process (empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test) developed by IDEO and Stanford d.school.

**How Threads is Different:**
- **Problem vs. tension:** Design Thinking assumes solvable problems; Threads addresses ongoing tensions
- **Diagnosis first:** Threads helps identify if the challenge is actually a navigable tension, not a solvable problem

**When to Use Design Thinking:**
- Innovation challenges with clear user needs
- Product development, service design
- Need rapid prototyping and testing

**When to Use Threads:**
- The "problem" keeps recurring despite solutions
- Stakeholders have irreconcilable perspectives
- Need to navigate tension, not solve a problem

**Use Both:**
- Use Threads to identify which tensions are at play
- Use Design Thinking to prototype solutions that honor both poles
- Example: EMBODIMENT thread (data vs. intuition) → prototype dashboards that integrate both

---

### **Threads vs. Theory U / Presencing**

**What is Theory U?**
Otto Scharmer's framework for deep change through "presencing"—accessing the future that wants to emerge.

**How Threads is Different:**
- **Diagnostic precision:** Threads names specific patterns; Theory U focuses on process of sensing
- **Immediate application:** Threads provides actionable language now; Theory U requires longer journey

**When to Use Theory U:**
- Deep transformational change
- Leadership development focused on awareness
- Need collective sensing and emergence

**When to Use Threads:**
- Need clarity on what's happening *now*
- Want specific interventions, not just process
- Leadership team needs shared diagnostic language

**Use Both:**
- Use Threads to name what's being sensed in presencing work
- Example: Theory U retreat surfaces BECOMING thread (identity evolution) → Threads provides language to navigate it
- Threads helps make Theory U insights actionable

---

### **Threads vs. Crucial Conversations**

**What are Crucial Conversations?**
Patterson, Grenny, et al.'s framework for high-stakes dialogue when opinions vary, stakes are high, and emotions run strong.

**How Threads is Different:**
- **Systemic vs. situational:** Threads addresses patterns; Crucial Conversations addresses specific moments
- **Diagnosis:** Threads helps you understand *which thread* is driving the crucial conversation

**When to Use Crucial Conversations:**
- Specific high-stakes dialogue
- Teaching communication skills
- Need to address a critical moment

**When to Use Threads:**
- Same crucial conversations keep happening
- Need to understand systemic pattern beneath individual conflicts
- Want to prevent crucial conversations by navigating threads proactively

**Use Both:**
- Use Threads to diagnose which thread is in collapse
- Use Crucial Conversations skills to have dialogue *about* thread navigation
- Example: CONSENT thread collapse → Crucial Conversation about decision rights

## When NOT to Use Threads

Threads is powerful, but not for everything. **Don't use Threads when:**

1. **You have a clear problem with a solution**
   - Example: "Our software has a bug" → Fix the bug (not a thread)
   - Threads is for tensions, not problems

2. **You need a process/methodology**
   - Example: "How do we run sprints?" → Use Agile (Threads doesn't provide process)

3. **The issue is individual skill-based**
   - Example: "Manager needs feedback skills" → Use coaching/training (Threads doesn't teach skills)

4. **You want a decision-making tool**
   - Example: "Should we pursue Strategy A or B?" → Use decision frameworks (Threads helps you hold the tension between them)

5. **It's an emergency requiring immediate action**
   - Example: "System is down, customers are affected" → Fix it now, reflect on threads later

---

## Summary: Threads as the Substrate

Think of Threads as the **diagnostic and navigational layer beneath other practices:**

- **Other frameworks** → What to do
- **Threads** → Why tensions arise and how to navigate them

You don't replace your existing toolbox—you add pattern recognition that helps you choose the right tool at the right time.
