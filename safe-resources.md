Good — this is exactly the right constraining move. What you’re describing is not a “program,” it’s a **shared micro-operating layer**. If this works, *everything else becomes optional enrichment*.

I’ll walk through this in three parts:

1. **Design principles for Minimum Viable S.A.F.E. (MV-S.A.F.E.)**
2. **Exact content + tone for the three 5-minute teacher one-pagers**
3. **Exact content + tone for the all-staff ultra-light pamphlet (with translation guidance)**

I’ll be precise, not poetic. This needs to survive reality.

## 0. The non-negotiable design rules (this keeps it from collapsing)

Before content, here are the rules that make MV-S.A.F.E. viable:

**Rule 1: No theory. No Threads. No philosophy.**
Threads live *behind* the curtain at this level. The school gets verbs, not metaphysics.

**Rule 2: No moralizing language.**
No “should,” no “right choice,” no “kindness expectations.” This is about *capacity*, not virtue signaling.

**Rule 3: Every adult can say one sentence and stop.**
If a crossing guard needs more than one sentence, the system fails.

**Rule 4: S.A.F.E. must work in 20 seconds or less.**
Longer conversations are optional upgrades, not required.

If we hold those, this works.

# 1. The Three 5-Minute Teacher One-Pagers

*(These are NOT handouts to students — they are scripts teachers read or paraphrase.)*

Each one-pager has:

* a **30-second framing**
* a **2-minute explanation**
* a **2-minute live practice**
* a **30-second close**

### One-Pager #1: “What S.A.F.E. Is (and Isn’t)”

**Purpose:** Prevent misuse, fear, and overreach.

#### 30-second framing (teacher script)

> “We’re going to learn a simple way to handle everyday conflicts — not emergencies. This is not about getting in trouble or fixing anyone. It’s about learning how to pause and choose who you want to be when things get hard.”

#### 2-minute explanation

> “S.A.F.E. has four steps. You don’t have to use all of them every time. Sometimes you’ll only use one.”

* **SEE** – Notice what’s happening (outside or in your body)
* **ASK** – Ask what someone is feeling or needing
* **FEEL** – Name your own feeling or need
* **EMERGE** – Choose how you want to act

> “Important: If someone is in danger, an adult steps in immediately. S.A.F.E. is for everyday conflicts — not emergencies.”

*(This protects SEE & ACT without naming it yet.)*

#### 2-minute practice (whole class)

Teacher gives a neutral scenario:

> “Someone cuts in line.”

Ask:

* “What could you SEE?”
* “What could you ASK?”
* “What might you FEEL?”
* “How could you EMERGE?”

No acting. Just answers.

#### 30-second close

> “We’re not trying to be perfect. We’re practicing noticing and choosing.”

---

### One-Pager #2: “Using S.A.F.E. in the Moment”

**Purpose:** Normalize partial use and speed.

#### 30-second framing

> “You don’t stop class for S.A.F.E. You use it *inside* what’s already happening.”

#### 2-minute explanation

> “Most of the time, S.A.F.E. sounds like one sentence.”

Examples teachers can say:

* “I SEE something happening here.”
* “Can you ASK what they need?”
* “Can you FEEL what’s going on in your body?”
* “Pause — who do you want to be right now?”

> “That’s it. You’re not fixing the conflict. You’re creating space.”

#### 2-minute practice

Teacher reads 3 quick scenarios, students answer with *one S.A.F.E. word* they’d use first.

Example:

* “Two students arguing loudly” → SEE or PAUSE
* “Someone looks upset but silent” → ASK
* “You feel like yelling” → FEEL

#### 30-second close

> “If you only remember one word, that’s enough.”

---

### One-Pager #3: “What Happens When It Doesn’t Work”

**Purpose:** Prevent teacher burnout and guilt.

#### 30-second framing

> “Sometimes S.A.F.E. won’t work. That doesn’t mean you failed.”

#### 2-minute explanation

> “If emotions are too big, or someone won’t engage, adults step in. Safety comes first.”

Clear language:

* “We pause S.A.F.E.”
* “We handle safety.”
* “We can return later — or not.”

> “S.A.F.E. is practice, not a test.”

#### 2-minute reflection

Ask students:

* “What makes it hard to use S.A.F.E.?”
* “When might you need adult help?”

Normalize limits.

#### 30-second close

> “Learning this takes time. Even adults are still practicing.”

# 2. The S.A.F.E. Poster (Student-Facing)

This poster must be **visually calm and linguistically sparse**.

### Title

**S.A.F.E. — When Something Feels Hard**

### Content (exact wording)

* **SEE**
  *What’s happening?*

* **ASK**
  *What do you need? What do they need?*

* **FEEL**
  *What am I feeling in my body?*

* **EMERGE**
  *Who do I want to be right now?*

### Bottom line (small text)

> *You don’t have to use every step. One is enough.*

That last line is crucial. It prevents paralysis.

# 3. Ultra-Light All-Staff Pamphlet (English / Spanish / Creole)

This is the **linchpin**. If this works, the culture spreads.

### Format

* Half-sheet, tri-fold
* Front: what it is
* Inside: what to say
* Back: when NOT to use it

### Front (all staff)

**S.A.F.E. — A Simple Way to Handle Everyday Conflict**

> “S.A.F.E. helps students pause, name what’s happening, and choose how to act. It’s for everyday situations — not emergencies.”

---

### Inside: “What You Can Say” (this is the money)

**You only need ONE sentence.**

* “I SEE something happening.”
* “Can you ASK what they need?”
* “I FEEL a lot of tension here — let’s pause.”
* “Who do you want to be right now?”

That’s it. No explaining.

---

### Back: “When NOT to Use S.A.F.E.”

Clear, bold section:

> **Do NOT use S.A.F.E. when:**
>
> * Someone is being hurt
> * There is a threat or weapon
> * A child is out of control
> * You are worried about safety

> **In those moments:**
> Step in. Get help. Handle safety first.

> “S.A.F.E. can wait.”

This sentence protects everyone legally and emotionally.

---

## Translation Guidance (important)

Do **not** translate word-for-word mechanically.

Instead:

* Keep **SEE / ASK / FEEL / EMERGE** in English as anchors
* Translate the *descriptions* underneath

This keeps consistency across languages while honoring comprehension.

Example (Spanish):

* SEE — *¿Qué está pasando?*
* ASK — *¿Qué necesitas?*
* FEEL — *¿Qué sientes en tu cuerpo?*
* EMERGE — *¿Quién quieres ser ahora?*

Same for Creole — simple, direct, no idioms.

---

## Final reality check (no smoke)

If a school:

* reads the three one-pagers
* hangs the poster
* gives every adult the pamphlet

Then within **two weeks**, you will hear:

* students using the words spontaneously
* adults interrupting conflict without escalating it
* fewer “who started it?” conversations

Not because it’s magical — but because **shared verbs change behavior faster than shared values**.

If you want, next step we can:

* tighten this to a single printable packet
* test it against a hostile staff room
* or design the *exact first-day rollout script*

But this?
This is genuinely viable.
