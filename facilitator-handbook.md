PART I
Facilitator Competency Framework
Overview
The Facilitator Competency Framework identifies the knowledge, skills, and capacities required for effective Threads facilitation. It serves three purposes: guiding facilitator development, structuring assessment, and ensuring consistent quality across the practitioner community.

"Competence in this work is not about perfection. It's about the capacity to stay present to tension while facilitating movement toward what wants to emerge."
The Five Competency Domains
Domain
Description
1. Conceptual Mastery
Deep understanding of the seven threads, their interactions, and the philosophical foundations of the framework
2. Thread Recognition
Ability to identify active threads in real-time, including subtle manifestations and interactions between threads
3. Facilitative Presence
Capacity to remain grounded, curious, and non-anxious while holding space for creative tension
4. Intervention Skill
Repertoire of facilitation techniques and the judgment to apply them appropriately to context
5. Ethical Integration
Awareness of scope, boundaries, and the ethical dimensions of holding space for others' development


Domain 1: Conceptual Mastery
Conceptual mastery goes beyond memorizing definitions. It means understanding the framework deeply enough to explain it in multiple ways, recognize its application in diverse contexts, and engage thoughtfully with questions and challenges.
Component 1.1: Thread Understanding
Can articulate each of the seven threads with clarity and depth
Understands the dialectical nature of each thread (the tension it holds)
Can explain how threads manifest differently across contexts (individual, relational, organizational)
Recognizes the developmental nature of thread engagement
Component 1.2: Framework Architecture
Understands the relationship between threads (how they interact and influence each other)
Can explain the philosophical foundations (process theology, dialectics, emergence)
Articulates how the framework differs from problem-solving approaches
Understands the role of creative tension in transformation
Component 1.3: Contextual Application
Can adapt language and examples to different audiences
Understands how professional context shapes application
Recognizes scope limitations and integration with other modalities
Developmental Indicators
Level
Indicators
Emerging
Can define threads accurately; relies on standard examples; struggles with novel questions
Developing
Generates original examples; explains thread interactions; handles common questions confidently
Proficient
Adapts explanations to context; engages complex questions; integrates with other frameworks
Advanced
Contributes to framework development; mentors others; handles philosophical challenges


Domain 2: Thread Recognition
Thread recognition is the ability to identify which threads are active in a given situation—often multiple threads simultaneously—and to track their movement in real-time. This is the foundational skill of applied practice.
Component 2.1: Pattern Recognition
Identifies explicit thread language (when people name their experience)
Recognizes implicit thread dynamics (unspoken tensions)
Tracks multiple threads simultaneously
Notices shifts in thread salience over time
Component 2.2: Thread Interaction
Recognizes when one thread activates another
Identifies thread clusters common to particular situations
Understands how resolving one tension may surface another
Component 2.3: Contextual Sensitivity
Recognizes how context shapes thread expression
Distinguishes between presenting concerns and underlying threads
Notices cultural and systemic factors that shape thread dynamics
RECOGNITION TIP
Listen for the word 'but'—it often signals a tension between threads.
'I want to speak up, but I don't want to damage the relationship.'
This signals threads of Consent (agency) and Connection (relationship).



Domain 3: Facilitative Presence
Facilitative presence is the capacity to remain grounded, curious, and non-anxious while holding space for creative tension. It is both a quality of being and a set of practices that can be cultivated.
Component 3.1: Self-Regulation
Maintains emotional regulation in the face of intensity
Recognizes and manages own thread activations
Practices appropriate self-disclosure
Returns to presence when activated
Component 3.2: Holding Space
Tolerates ambiguity without rushing to resolution
Stays with discomfort (own and others') without rescuing
Creates safety without over-protecting
Trusts the process even when outcomes are uncertain
Component 3.3: Relational Attunement
Tracks emotional states of individuals and groups
Reads the room for readiness and capacity
Calibrates pacing to what system can integrate
Maintains connection while allowing distance
COMMON PITFALL
Facilitators often confuse 'holding space' with 'being passive.'
Holding space is active—it requires attunement, presence, and sometimes
intervention. Passivity can be a form of abandonment.



Domain 4: Intervention Skill
Intervention skill is the repertoire of facilitation techniques and the judgment to apply them appropriately. It includes knowing what to do, when to do it, and when to do nothing.
Component 4.1: Naming & Framing
Names threads in accessible language
Reframes problems as creative tensions
Offers thread language as invitation, not prescription
Times naming for maximum impact
Component 4.2: Questions & Inquiries
Uses open questions that deepen exploration
Asks thread-specific questions that illuminate dynamics
Knows when to ask and when to sit with silence
Follows curiosity without agenda
Component 4.3: Process Facilitation
Designs processes that honor creative tension
Facilitates movement between poles
Knows when to intervene and when to let process unfold
Adapts approach based on what emerges
Component 4.4: Working with Resistance
Recognizes resistance as information, not obstacle
Responds to resistance with curiosity, not force
Distinguishes productive resistance from avoidance
Uses resistance to deepen the work
Intervention Timing Matrix
When to Name
When to Wait
When to Redirect
Tension is implicit but active
Person is actively processing
Conversation is going in circles
Language might provide relief
Energy is building productively
Different thread needs attention
Insight seems close to surface
Silence is generative
Scope boundaries approached


Domain 5: Ethical Integration
Ethical integration is the awareness of scope, boundaries, and the ethical dimensions of holding space for others' development. It includes both technical ethics (rules and standards) and relational ethics (care and responsibility).
Component 5.1: Scope Awareness
Understands the boundaries of Threads facilitation
Recognizes when to refer to other professionals
Maintains appropriate relationship with primary professional role
Does not overstate framework capabilities
Component 5.2: Boundary Management
Maintains appropriate relational boundaries
Navigates dual relationships thoughtfully
Practices appropriate confidentiality
Manages power dynamics ethically
Component 5.3: Harm Prevention
Recognizes signs of distress requiring professional intervention
Knows when not to proceed with tension work
Has clear safety protocols in place
Takes responsibility for impact of facilitation
Component 5.4: Ongoing Development
Engages in regular supervision and consultation
Maintains awareness of own limitations
Participates in continuing education
Contributes to community development

Competency Integration
While described separately, the five domains work together in practice. Effective facilitation requires integration across all five:

 provides the foundation for recognizing threadsConceptual Mastery
 informs intervention decisionsThread Recognition
 enables interventions to landFacilitative Presence
 expresses conceptual understanding in actionIntervention Skill
 shapes all other domainsEthical Integration

Development in one domain often catalyzes development in others. For example, deepening presence often improves recognition, and improved recognition enables more skillful intervention.

PART II
Common Questions & Misconceptions
Conceptual Questions
"Aren't these just different words for the same thing?"
While there is overlap between some threads, each represents a distinct phenomenological experience and developmental challenge. The threads are distinguished by:
The specific tension they hold (what is in creative opposition)
The developmental journey they invite
The characteristic questions they raise
The kinds of movement they enable

When threads seem similar, ask: 'What is the core tension in each?' The answer will reveal the distinction.
"How do I know which thread to focus on?"
Follow the energy. The most salient thread is usually the one the person or group is already wrestling with, even if implicitly. Look for:
What keeps coming up in different forms
Where the emotional charge is highest
What question seems to underlie other questions
What they keep circling back to

You don't have to choose one thread. Often naming the interaction between threads is most helpful.
"What if I name the wrong thread?"
There is no 'wrong' thread in most cases—only more or less generative framings. If your naming doesn't resonate:
Notice their response (verbal and nonverbal)
Stay curious: 'Does that fit, or is something else going on?'
Let them correct or redirect you
Use the mismatch as information

Your job isn't to be right; it's to facilitate their exploration.

Application Questions
"How is this different from just having a conversation?"
Threads facilitation is intentional in ways ordinary conversation is not:
: Consciously tracking thread dynamics rather than following content - Attention
: Naming tensions as creative rather than problematic - Framing
: Slowing down to allow integration - Pacing
: Trusting the process rather than pushing for resolution - Trust

However, when done well, it should feel like a natural conversation—just one with unusual depth and movement.
"When should I NOT use the Threads framework?"
The framework is not appropriate when:
Safety is the immediate concern (crisis intervention)
Technical or factual information is what's needed
The person needs containment more than exploration
Professional boundaries would be violated
The person has not consented to this kind of work

REMEMBER
Threads facilitation is one tool, not the only tool.
Competent practitioners know when NOT to use it.


"How long does it take to see change?"
Change happens on multiple timescales:
: Shift in understanding or perspective (often in a single conversation) - Immediate
: New behaviors emerge (days to weeks) - Short-term
: Deep patterns transform (months to years) - Long-term

The framework doesn't promise or guarantee change—it creates conditions where change becomes possible. Rushing the timeline usually backfires.

Relationship to Other Frameworks
"How does this relate to IFS (Internal Family Systems)?"
The frameworks are complementary. IFS focuses on internal parts and their relationships; Threads focuses on the tensions those parts often hold. Integration points:
Parts often represent poles of a thread (e.g., a protective part and an adventurous part holding Stability/Change)
Threads language can help parts understand their purpose
Both frameworks emphasize Self-leadership and presence

Threads does not require parts language and can be used with people unfamiliar with IFS.
"How does this relate to polarity management?"
The Threads framework draws on polarity thinking but extends it:
Polarities describe interdependent opposites; threads add developmental and phenomenological depth
Polarity management is often organizational; threads work at multiple levels
Threads emphasize transformation, not just management

Practitioners familiar with Barry Johnson's work will find conceptual alignment.
"How does this relate to therapy?"
Threads facilitation is not therapy, but therapists can integrate it into clinical practice:
Framework provides language that many clients find helpful
Threads perspective can inform case conceptualization
Works well with many therapeutic modalities

The key distinction: therapy addresses pathology and treatment; Threads addresses development and emergence. They can coexist.

Common Misconceptions
Misconception: "The goal is to resolve tensions."
Reality: The goal is to transform our relationship to tensions. Some tensions resolve; others are lifelong companions that we learn to navigate with increasing wisdom. Resolution-seeking can actually prevent development.
Misconception: "Some threads are better than others."
Reality: All threads represent essential human experiences. No thread is inherently problematic or superior. What matters is how consciously we engage them.
Misconception: "You have to use all seven threads."
Reality: Different situations activate different threads. A single conversation might engage one or two; a long-term relationship might eventually touch all seven. Use what's alive.
Misconception: "This is just positive thinking."
Reality: The framework honors difficulty, pain, and struggle. It doesn't reframe everything as 'good'—it reframes certain kinds of struggle as potentially generative. This is fundamentally different from toxic positivity.
Misconception: "Anyone can facilitate after Tier 1."
Reality: Tier 1 introduces the framework for personal application. Facilitating others requires the additional training, supervision, and assessment of Tier 2. Facilitating facilitators requires Tier 3. These boundaries exist to protect both practitioners and those they serve.

PART III
Assessment Criteria
Assessment Philosophy
Assessment in the Threads training pathway serves development, not gatekeeping. The goal is to help candidates grow while ensuring minimum competencies are met for ethical practice.

"Assessment is not about catching people doing things wrong. It's about helping them see clearly so they can grow."

Assessment Principles
: Feedback helps candidates improve, not just evaluatesDevelopment-oriented
: Focused on observable behaviors, not personalityCompetency-based
: Accounts for different professional contextsContextually-sensitive
: Criteria are shared in advance; no surprisesTransparent
: Includes self-assessment, peer feedback, supervisor evaluationMulti-source

Feedback Protocol
After observation, follow this protocol for feedback:

Private reflection (5 min): Observer reviews notes, identifies key themes
Candidate self-assessment (5 min): What went well? What would you do differently?
Strengths first (5 min): Observer shares 2-3 specific strengths with examples
Growth areas (10 min): Observer shares 1-2 development areas with specific examples and suggestions
Questions and dialogue (10 min): Candidate asks questions; both explore
Action items (5 min): Candidate identifies 1-2 specific practice commitments

FEEDBACK PRINCIPLE
Feedback should model the framework: Hold both appreciation and challenge.
Neither inflate nor deflate. Help the candidate see clearly.
The goal is development, not judgment.


PART V
Supervision Case Examples
Using These Cases
These case examples are designed for supervision practice. Each presents a scenario a supervisee might bring, followed by discussion prompts that model effective supervision questions.

These cases can be used for:
Supervisor training (how would you respond?)
Peer consultation practice
Self-reflection (what would I do?)
Assessment role-plays

Case 1: The Stuck Client
Supervisee Presentation:
"I've been working with this client for three sessions. She keeps describing the same situation—feeling stuck between caring for her aging mother and pursuing her career. Every session she talks about it, I name the Consent thread, she says 'yes, that's it,' and then nothing changes. I feel like I'm failing."


Supervision Discussion Prompts
What do you notice about your own experience when you describe feeling like you're failing?
When you name the Consent thread, what happens in her body? In the room?
What would it look like if 'nothing changing' were actually appropriate right now?
Are there other threads present that might be interacting with Consent?
What's your hypothesis about why naming the thread isn't producing movement?

Teaching Points
Naming a thread is not the same as working with it
'Stuckness' may indicate a thread interaction (perhaps Memory or Connection is also active)
The supervisee's anxiety may be creating pressure that prevents movement
Sometimes the work is honoring the weight of a tension, not resolving it

Case 2: The Resistant Couple
Supervisee Presentation:
"This couple came in saying they wanted to work on communication. But every time I try to introduce thread language, one partner rolls his eyes and says 'we don't need fancy theories, we just need to talk.' His wife seems interested but won't engage when he's dismissive. I don't know whether to push through or abandon the framework."


Supervision Discussion Prompts
What thread might be active for the dismissive partner right now?
What happens in you when he rolls his eyes?
Is it possible to use the framework without using the language?
What is the wife's eye-roll telling you about their system?
What would happen if you named what's happening in the room as a tension?

Teaching Points
Resistance is information, not obstacle—what is it protecting?
Probably a Consent thread for him: 'Will this take away my agency?'
Framework can be applied without explicit framework language
The dynamic between partners IS the material
Sometimes joining the resistance is more effective than pushing against it

Case 3: The Over-Functioning Facilitator
Supervisee Presentation:
"I facilitated a workshop last week and I'm exhausted. I realized I was doing all the work—naming threads, making connections, offering reframes. Participants were nodding and agreeing but not generating their own insights. How do I get them to do more of the work?"


Supervision Discussion Prompts
What would it feel like to sit in silence longer?
What's the thread underneath your need to fill the space?
What might participants be learning from your over-functioning?
How might your exhaustion be useful information?
What would you need to trust in order to do less?

Teaching Points
Over-functioning prevents participant ownership and integration
Supervisee may be working their own Consent thread (needing to be helpful)
Silence and spaciousness are facilitation interventions
Exhaustion is a signal—the system is out of balance
Questions that generate insight are often more powerful than offering insight

Case 4: The Team Conflict
Supervisee Presentation:
"I'm consulting with a leadership team that's in open conflict. Two factions have formed around different strategic directions. The CEO asked me to 'fix it' using the framework. In our first session, the tension was so high people were interrupting and talking over each other. I froze and didn't know what to do."


Supervision Discussion Prompts
What was happening in your body when you froze?
What thread was most active in the room? What thread was active in you?
The CEO asked you to 'fix it'—what's problematic about that framing?
What would need to happen before thread work could be productive here?
Is it possible to name what's happening without taking sides?

Teaching Points
High conflict requires safety-building before exploration
'Fixing' conflict is not the frame—transforming relationship to conflict is
The facilitator's freeze is data about the system's intensity
May need to work with the CEO separately on expectations
Sometimes slowing down and naming process is the intervention

Case 5: The Ethical Dilemma
Supervisee Presentation:
"A client disclosed something in our session that worries me. She's been struggling with dark thoughts and mentioned she sometimes thinks about 'ending it all.' She quickly said she wouldn't actually do anything, but I don't know if I should believe her. She's not my therapy client—I'm her leadership coach. What do I do?"


Supervision Discussion Prompts
What's your sense of her safety right now?
What did you notice in her when she disclosed? When she said she wouldn't act on it?
What's the tension for you between honoring the coaching relationship and ensuring safety?
What would be the impact of asking directly about suicide?
What's your ethical obligation here? What resources do you have?

Teaching Points
Safety always takes priority over maintaining frame
Direct questions about suicide are appropriate and necessary
This is at the edge of scope—consultation and referral are essential
The coaching relationship may need to pause while safety is addressed
Supervisee needs clear guidance on action steps, not just exploration
