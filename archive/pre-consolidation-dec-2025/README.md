# Archived Documentation - Pre-Consolidation (December 2025)

This folder contains documentation files that were consolidated into the new 4-document structure on December 27, 2025.

## Why These Were Archived

These documents contained overlapping information spread across 8 files, making it difficult to:
- Find the most current information
- Distinguish between planned vs. implemented features
- Know which document to update
- Maintain consistency across files

## New Documentation Structure

The information from these files has been consolidated and reorganized into:

1. **[PLATFORM-OVERVIEW.md](../../PLATFORM-OVERVIEW.md)** - Stakeholder-facing business model and strategy
2. **[PLATFORM-TECHNICAL-SPEC.md](../../PLATFORM-TECHNICAL-SPEC.md)** - Developer-facing technical architecture
3. **[TRAINING-SYSTEM-DESIGN.md](../../TRAINING-SYSTEM-DESIGN.md)** - Content creator-facing training design
4. **[IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md](../../IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md)** - Team-facing current status and priorities
