# **Contributing to The Spiral of Becoming**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to The Spiral of Becoming\! This is a living framework that grows through collective wisdom and practice. Your insights, questions, and experiences are valuable additions to this ongoing exploration.

## **Philosophy of Contribution**

The Spiral of Becoming is not owned by any individual or tradition—it belongs to everyone who engages with it and no one who would possess it. We welcome contributions that:

* Honor the framework as a living process rather than fixed doctrine  
* Respect diverse traditions without appropriating or reducing them  
* Focus on universal human experiences while celebrating particular expressions  
* Emphasize questions and tensions rather than definitive answers  
* Build bridges between ancient wisdom and emerging understanding

## **Guidelines for All Contributions**

### **Language and Tone**

* Use inclusive, accessible language  
* Avoid jargon without explanation  
* Write with humility—"one perspective" not "the truth"  
* Acknowledge limitations and growing edges  
* Invite further exploration rather than closing discussion

### **Cultural Sensitivity**

* Don't speak for traditions not your own  
* Cite sources and acknowledge origins  
* Avoid reducing complex traditions to simple concepts  
* When in doubt, frame as questions rather than statements  
* Be willing to be corrected and learn

### **The Both/And Practice**

When contributing, practice holding tensions:

* Honor tradition AND welcome innovation  
* Maintain structure AND allow emergence  
* Be specific AND stay universal  
* Offer expertise AND remain curious

## **Review Process**

All contributions will be reviewed with these considerations:

1. **Universality**: Does this resonate across difference?
2. **Creativity**: Does it open possibilities rather than close them?  
3. **Respect**: Does it honor without appropriating?  
4. **Practicality**: Can communities actually use this?  
5. **Alignment**: Does it fit the spirit of creative tension?

Reviews are not about gatekeeping but about collective discernment. Feedback will be offered in the spirit of "Yes, and..." rather than "No, but..."

## **Versioning**

We commit to:

* **Holding creative tension** when disagreements arise  
* **Seeking understanding** before seeking to be understood

* Annual community acknowledgment

## **Questions?**

If you're unsure about a contribution, open an issue with the "Question" label. We'd rather explore together than have you hesitate to contribute.

Remember: The Spiral of Becoming is itself becoming. Your contribution, however small, is part of its evolution. We're not looking for perfection but for authentic engagement with these universal tensions.
