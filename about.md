## **About the Threads of Becoming**

### **In What Order or Shape are the Threads?**

The Threads of Becoming aren't locked into any single order or shape or metaphor. Like water taking the form of its container while maintaining its essential nature, these universal tensions can be understood through whatever geometry serves your purpose, tradition, or learning style. The framework remains consistent whether you visualize it as spiral, web, wheel, or any other pattern that helps you engage. Choose the metaphor that makes the tensions come alive for you:

- **Path/Journey** - Linear progress through the threads
- **Circle/Wheel** - Continuous cycle without beginning or end
- **Spiral** - Returning to same tensions at deeper/outer levels
- **Web** - All threads interconnected, affecting each other
- **Constellation** - Navigate by different stars in different seasons
- **Musical Scale** - various modalities of notes creating infinite melodies
- **Breath** - Inhale/exhale rhythm of tension and release
- **River System** - Tributaries flowing together and apart
- **Loom/Weaving** - Threads held in tension create the fabric
- **Mycelial Network** - Underground connections exchanging resources

There is no "correct" visualization. The framework succeeds when you find the form that helps you hold creative tension rather than resolve it. Draw it, dance it, diagram it however brings it alive. The multiplicity of forms teaches the same lesson as the tensions themselves: hold both/all rather than choosing one.

## **The Process Invitation**

Let's ensure the Threads remain a **living process** rather than crystallizing into doctrine. This is Becoming embodied \- even this iteration of the framework for understanding process must itself remain in process.

### **The Power of Questions**

"The Threads" is a **framework for dialogue**.

**We imagine rich possibilities:**
- How might Christian mystics and Buddhist practitioners compare notes on PRESENCE?
- What happens when Indigenous elders and quantum physicists explore MEMORY together?
- Could Muslim practices of surrender and Stoic practices of agency illuminate CONSENT differently?
- What emerges when trauma therapists and shamans discuss EMBODIMENT?

**Thread Pathways:**

1. **These are just glimpses, not limits, of infinite possible conversations. What combinations intrigue you?**

2. **Nobody owns any thread. Everyone might contribute to every thread. What wisdom does your tradition or experience offer?**

3. **Nobody has THE answer. Everyone has AN answer. What conversations do you imagine?**

### **The Meta-Question**

Each thread also contains questions about creative tension itself:

* How do we hold opposites or many truths without choosing sides?
* When is tension creative and when is it destructive?  
* What wants to emerge from this particular tension?
* Where does the tension vibrate within us to create maximum possibilities?

### **The Invitation This Creates**

We're not saying "I have figured out the universal pattern." We're saying "I've noticed these questions keep appearing. How do you engage them more and more skillfully?"

This is radically inclusive. It makes space for:

* The atheist who rejects religious answers  
* The fundamentalist with specific answers  
* The mystic living the questions  
* The agnostic comfortable with not knowing

### **The Beautiful Paradox**

By offering questions instead of answers, the Threads become MORE universal, not less. Everyone has to grapple with these tensions. No tradition has solved them completely. We're all still learning.

This is Becoming at its best \- not a fixed theology but a recognition that we're all responding to the same cosmic questions from our unique positions in the creative advance.

### Why We Call Them Threads

We use the metaphor of **threads** because, like the strings of an instrument or the warp of a loom, they only become useful when held in creative tension between poles.

A slack thread produces nothing - no music, no fabric, no structure. An over-tightened thread snaps. But a thread held at appropriate tension between opposing points becomes **generative** - it can vibrate with music, support weaving, create patterns, hold weight.

Each thread represents a fundamental tension that runs through human experience - pulled between two or more truths that seem oppositional but are actually partners:
- Presence stretches between **Being Here** and **Being Elsewhere**
- Consent stretches between **Agency** and **Surrender**  
- Memory stretches between **Holding On** and **Letting Go**

The poles aren't problems to solve by choosing one side. They're the anchor points that create the tension that makes the thread useful. Without both/many poles, the thread goes slack and loses its generative power.

Like a spider's web, these threads are strongest when woven together - each thread supporting and tensioning the others. When we consciously hold these tensions rather than trying to resolve them, we create a living structure strong enough to catch meaning, flexible enough to move with change, and resilient enough to repair itself when torn.

The word "thread" also carries the sense of continuity - the thread that runs through a story, the thread of connection between people, the thread of becoming that connects who we were to who we're becoming. These are the threads we follow through the labyrinth of transformation, not to escape but to journey deeper into creative engagement with life's fundamental tensions.

#### **"The Living Invitation"**

*The current threads we've identified are not THE threads but OUR threads \- the ones we've discovered so far in our own and our community's becomings. The Threads of Becoming itself is in process, always ready to receive new wisdom.*

*We invite you to:*

* *Notice what threads run through your own life*  
* *Share threads from your tradition we haven't seen*  
* *Weave new threads as our community discovers them*  
* *Challenge threads that no longer serve*  
* *Let the Threads themselves thread into new forms*

*This is not THE Threads or MY Threads \- it's living Threads that belong to everyone who engages them and no one who would possess them.*

### **The Version Control Model**

Like open-source software:

* **Threads 1.0**: The original seven threads  
* **Threads 1.1**: Community adds WITNESS thread  
* **Threads 2.0**: Major revision based on collective learning  
* **Personal Forks**: Individuals create their own versions  
* **Merge/Pull Requests**: New insights integrated back into community version

### **The Meta-Thread**

This openness itself becomes a thread:

**EVOLUTION** **The Tension:** _Stability vs. Transformation_

* What needs to remain constant for growth?  
* How does the container itself need to change?  
* When does flexibility become chaos?  
* When does structure become prison?

### **The Profound Implication**

By making the Threads explicitly open and evolving, we're:

* Modeling the very process we're teaching  
* Preventing the original framework from becoming dogma  
* Inviting genuine co-creation  
* Acknowledging the founder's perspective is incomplete  
* Creating space for future wisdom

This transforms it from "Ron's framework" to "humanity's ongoing discovery" \- we're just the current stewards of an ancient and future wisdom.

### **The Beautiful Recursion**

The Threads of Becoming is itself becoming. It demonstrates its own teaching \- that everything is in process, nothing is final, and creative tension generates new possibilities.

This openness doesn't weaken the framework \- it's what makes it trustworthy. People can engage knowing they're not being recruited into a fixed system or coerced into a false conformity but invited into a living practice.
