# Threads Facilitated Assessment: Guide for Deep Exploration

## Overview

While self-report assessments provide valuable starting points, facilitated assessment offers something different: **observation of collapse in real-time** by a trained guide who can see what the person cannot.

This guide is for trained facilitators conducting in-depth Thread assessments with individuals or groups. It includes:
- Session structure and flow
- Scenario-based assessment techniques
- Observation protocols
- Interpretation frameworks
- Feedback delivery approaches

---

## When to Use Facilitated Assessment

**Facilitated assessment is indicated when:**

- Self-report results don't match observed behavior
- The person has limited self-awareness about their patterns
- Deeper understanding is needed for focused development
- The person is training to become a facilitator themselves
- Group dynamics need to be understood
- High-stakes development work requires precision

**Facilitated assessment adds value through:**

- Real-time observation of collapse (not just self-report)
- Probing questions that surface blind spots
- Professional interpretation of patterns
- Immediate feedback and reflection
- Customized development recommendations

## Thread-by-Thread Facilitated Exploration

For each Thread, the facilitator uses a combination of:
1. **Direct questions** — Asking about the capacity
2. **Scenario prompts** — Presenting triggering situations
3. **Real-time observation** — Watching how the person responds
4. **Probing** — Following threads that reveal collapse

### PAUSE Assessment

**Direct Questions:**
- "When something triggers you—a comment, a post, something someone says—what typically happens next?"
- "How long is the gap, usually, between being triggered and responding?"
- "What helps you create space before reacting? What makes that harder?"

**Scenario Prompt:**
> "Imagine you're at a family dinner. Your uncle, who you disagree with politically, makes a comment that feels inflammatory and wrong. In your mind's eye, notice what happens in the first 3 seconds after he speaks."

*Then ask:* "What did you notice? What was the impulse?"

**Observation Markers:**
- How quickly do they answer questions? (Impulsive PAUSE collapse: instant answers)
- Do they interrupt the facilitator? (PAUSE collapse toward reactivity)
- Do they struggle to formulate responses? (PAUSE collapse toward paralysis)
- What happens in their body when imagining the scenario?

**Probing:**
- "What would happen if you waited 30 seconds before responding?"
- "Is the pause you described typical, or are you describing your ideal?"
- "When was the last time you reacted faster than you wanted to?"

---

### EMBODIMENT Assessment

**Direct Questions:**
- "Right now, in this moment, what are you noticing in your body?"
- "When you think about political disagreements, where do you feel that in your body?"
- "How do you typically experience emotions—more in your head or in your body?"

**Scenario Prompt:**
> "I'm going to read you a political statement. Notice what happens in your body as you hear it."
> *[Read a statement likely to be triggering based on what you know of the person]*

*Then ask:* "What did you notice? What happened in your chest? Your jaw? Your hands?"

**Observation Markers:**
- Can they identify body sensations, or do they answer cognitively?
- Do they notice their own body language during the session?
- When discussing difficult topics, do they become more or less embodied?
- Physical signs of disembodiment: blank gaze, monotone voice, rigidity

**Probing:**
- "You mentioned feeling [emotion]. Where is that in your body right now?"
- "I notice your shoulders just rose. What's happening?"
- "If your gut could speak right now, what would it say?"

---

### CONSENT Assessment

**Direct Questions:**
- "When someone you care about holds a view you think is harmful, what happens?"
- "What's the difference for you between sharing your perspective and needing them to agree?"
- "Have political disagreements affected any of your relationships?"

**Scenario Prompt:**
> "Someone you love—a sibling, a close friend—tells you they're voting for a candidate you find morally problematic. They explain their reasoning. You disagree completely. What do you do?"

*Then ask:* "What's the pull? To convince them? To distance? Something else?"

**Observation Markers:**
- Do they need the facilitator to agree with them during the session?
- How do they respond to facilitator's neutral stance?
- Do they attempt to change the facilitator's mind about anything?
- How do they talk about people they disagree with?

**Probing:**
- "What would it mean to let them be wrong?"
- "If you couldn't change their mind, could you still be close?"
- "What's at stake if they don't see it your way?"

---

### THRESHOLD Assessment

**Direct Questions:**
- "What topics are difficult for you to discuss? What makes them hard?"
- "When conversations get uncomfortable, what do you typically do?"
- "How long can you sit with tension before needing to resolve it?"

**Scenario Prompt:**
> "We're going to sit in a bit of silence. During the silence, I want you to hold the thought: 'This person I love may never change their mind about this important issue.' Just hold that. Notice what happens."
> *[Hold 30-60 seconds of silence]*

*Then ask:* "What happened? What was the urge? To fill the space? To escape? To fix?"

**Observation Markers:**
- How do they handle pauses in conversation?
- Do they change subjects when things get difficult?
- Any signs of fight (escalation) or flight (withdrawal)?
- Physical signs: increased movement, looking away, crossing arms

**Probing:**
- "What were you wanting to escape just now?"
- "What would happen if you stayed with that discomfort longer?"
- "What's the worst that could happen if you don't resolve this tension?"

---

### MEMORY Assessment

**Direct Questions:**
- "Where did your core political beliefs come from? Family? Community? Experience?"
- "Have you examined which of your views are inherited versus chosen?"
- "When someone challenges your views, does it ever feel like they're challenging your family or your people?"

**Scenario Prompt:**
> "Think of a political position you hold strongly. I want you to trace it back. Where did you first learn this view? Who taught it to you? What story accompanies it?"

*Then ask:* "Is this your view, or is this your family's view that you've adopted? How would you know the difference?"

**Observation Markers:**
- How do they talk about "their side" vs. "the other side"?
- Do they use language that suggests possession by narrative ("we've always," "they always")?
- Can they hold their inheritance with any critical distance?
- Do they get defensive when asked about the origins of their views?

**Probing:**
- "What would your family think if you changed this view?"
- "What story about 'them' did you inherit? Where did it come from?"
- "Which of your views have you actually chosen, versus received?"

---

### UNCERTAINTY Assessment

**Direct Questions:**
- "On a contested political issue, how certain are you that you're right?"
- "What would make you change your mind about something important?"
- "How comfortable are you saying 'I don't know' on issues you care about?"

**Scenario Prompt:**
> "Name a political issue where you have a strong view. Now, imagine you're in a room with the smartest, most good-faith advocate of the opposite position. They present evidence you haven't heard before. What happens?"

*Then ask:* "How open are you, really? Would it change anything?"

**Observation Markers:**
- How do they respond to facilitator questions they don't know the answer to?
- Do they acknowledge complexity or default to certainty?
- Can they express genuine doubt, or does doubt feel threatening?
- How do they handle ambiguity in the conversation?

**Probing:**
- "What are you less certain about than you present?"
- "What would you lose if you weren't sure about this?"
- "Where might you be wrong and not know it?"

---

### BECOMING Assessment

**Direct Questions:**
- "Have your political views changed significantly over the years?"
- "If you changed your mind on a major issue, what would that mean about you?"
- "How do you think about the relationship between your views and your identity?"

**Scenario Prompt:**
> "Imagine waking up in 10 years having changed your mind on something you currently hold strongly. The 10-years-from-now you has good reasons—not weakness, not selling out, but genuine growth. What's your response to that future self?"

*Then ask:* "Is that possible? Would it be betrayal or growth? What feelings come up?"

**Observation Markers:**
- How fused is their identity with their positions?
- Do they have a narrative of growth and change, or stability and consistency?
- How do they talk about people who changed their minds?
- Does the possibility of change feel exciting or threatening?

**Probing:**
- "What position have you changed in the last 5 years?"
- "If you weren't [political identity], who would you be?"
- "What would have to be true for you to evolve on this issue?"

---

## Observation Protocol

### What to Watch For

**Verbal markers:**
- Absolute language ("always," "never," "they all")
- Identity fusion ("I AM a _______")
- Speed of speech (reactive = fast; frozen = slow or halting)
- Certainty markers ("obviously," "clearly," "everyone knows")

**Physical markers:**
- Breathing changes
- Postural shifts (leaning in = approach; leaning back = avoid)
- Facial expressions (tightening, flushing)
- Hand movements (gestures, fidgeting, clenching)
- Eye contact (too much = intensity; too little = avoidance)

**Emotional markers:**
- Tone shifts
- Emotional flooding
- Flatness or disconnection
- Defensiveness
- Vulnerability or openness

## Pattern Synthesis

After exploring all seven Threads, synthesize observations into a pattern profile.

### Synthesis Questions

1. **Which Threads showed lowest capacity?**
2. **What collapse directions were observed?**
3. **Which Threads cluster together?** (Collapse cascades)
4. **What triggered the most activation?** (Context sensitivity)
5. **What was the person's awareness level?** (Can they see their own collapse?)
6. **Does this match any signature patterns?** (See Collapse Patterns document)

### Pattern Hypothesis

Based on observations, formulate:

```
Primary Pattern: _______________________

Thread Priorities:
1. _____________ (lowest capacity)
2. _____________ (second priority)
3. _____________ (third priority)

Key Observations:
- Most significant collapse moment: _______________
- Blind spot identified: _______________
- Strength to leverage: _______________

Recommended Focus:
- HOLD step emphasis: H / O / L / D
- Development context: _______________
- Initial practice: _______________
```

## Feedback Delivery

### Principles

1. **Lead with observation, not judgment**
   - "I noticed that when we talked about X, you..."
   - NOT: "You have a problem with X"

2. **Invite reflection, not defense**
   - "Does that match your experience?"
   - "What do you make of that?"

3. **Name patterns, not pathology**
   - "There's a common pattern called the Righteous Reactor..."
   - "Many people do exactly this"

4. **Emphasize development, not deficit**
   - "This is where you have the most room to grow"
   - "Building capacity here would unlock a lot"

5. **Offer choice, not prescription**
   - "Some options for development include..."
   - "What feels most relevant to you?"

### Feedback Structure

**Step 1: Overall observation**
> "What I noticed across our conversation is that you have strong capacity in [X] and [Y], and there's room for development in [Z] and [W]."

**Step 2: Specific examples**
> "For example, when we explored [scenario], I observed [specific behavior]. This suggests [Thread] might be collapsing in [direction]."

**Step 3: Pattern naming**
> "There's a pattern that fits what I'm seeing. It's sometimes called the [Pattern Name]. Does that resonate?"

**Step 4: Invitation to reflect**
> "What's your response to hearing this? Does it match your experience? What surprised you?"

**Step 5: Development pathway**
> "Based on this, I'd suggest focusing on [Thread] using [HOLD step]. Here's what that practice might look like..."

## Facilitated Assessment for Groups

When assessing groups (teams, organizations, congregations), additional considerations apply.

### Group Dynamics to Observe

- **Collective collapse patterns**: Does the group have a signature?
- **Complementarity**: Do different members collapse in different ways?
- **Contagion**: Does one person's collapse trigger others?
- **Norms**: What collapse patterns does the group reward or punish?

### Group Assessment Approaches

**Option A: Individual + Synthesis**
- Assess individuals separately
- Aggregate profiles
- Identify group patterns

**Option B: Group Observation**
- Observe group in discussion
- Note collective dynamics
- Assess group-level collapse

**Option C: Facilitated Group Exploration**
- Guide group through Thread exploration together
- Observe interactions as they discuss
- Process as a group

### Group Feedback

Focus on:
- Collective patterns (not individual critique)
- Complementary strengths
- Practices the group can adopt together
- Norms that need to shift

---

## Facilitator Self-Care

### Your Own Collapse Awareness

Before facilitating, know:
- Your own Thread profile
- Your signature collapse pattern
- Your likely triggers in this conversation
- What you need to stay centered

### During Session

- Monitor your own body
- Notice if you're collapsing (e.g., needing to convince, avoiding discomfort)
- Take breaks if needed
- Stay curious rather than diagnostic

### After Session

- Process your own reactions
- Note what triggered you
- Supervision or peer consultation for difficult sessions
- Self-care practices

---

## Documentation and Follow-Up

### Session Documentation

Record:
- Assessment date and duration
- Summary of observations by Thread
- Pattern identification
- Development recommendations
- Person's response to feedback
- Agreed next steps

### Follow-Up Protocol

**Immediate:**
- Send summary within 24 hours
- Include development resources
- Offer support contact

**Short-term (2-4 weeks):**
- Check-in on initial practice
- Address obstacles
- Adjust recommendations if needed

**Long-term (3-6 months):**
- Re-assessment option
- Progress review
- Refined development pathway

## Facilitator Certification Notes

To conduct facilitated Threads assessments, facilitators should have:

1. **Personal development**: 6+ months of their own HOLD practice
2. **Framework mastery**: Deep understanding of all seven Threads
3. **Assessment training**: Specific instruction in this protocol
4. **Supervised practice**: At least 3 facilitated assessments with supervision
5. **Ongoing development**: Continued practice and peer consultation
