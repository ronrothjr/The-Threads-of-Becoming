# Threads for Educators

## Professional Development that Transforms How You Hold Space for Learning

Bring the power of polarity thinking into K-12 classrooms. Earn professional development credits while learning to help students navigate complexity with creativity and courage.

## Why Threads for Teaching?

### Student-Centered Learning
Help students navigate genuine tensions in their lives rather than memorizing answers.

### Social-Emotional Learning
Integrate SEL naturally through practicing how to hold difficult feelings and relationships.

### Classroom Management Transformation
Transform conflicts into learning opportunities by teaching students to hold tension together.

### Critical Thinking Development
Develop genuine critical thinking by practicing with multiple perspectives simultaneously.

### Inclusive Pedagogy
Create classrooms where differences become resources rather than problems to solve.

### Teacher Wellness and Sustainability
Sustain yourself by learning to hold the tensions of teaching without burning out.

## How Teachers Use Threads

Threads adapts to every developmental stage, from picture books to college essays.

### Elementary (K-5) | Ages 5-11

**Approach:** Use simple language and story-based exploration to introduce tension-holding through play and imagination.

**Classroom Applications:**
- **Story Time:** Identify tensions in children's literature (brave/scared, sharing/keeping)
- **Circle Time:** Practice PAUSE when conflicts arise—"Can we hold both feelings at once?"
- **Creative Play:** Act out different poles of a tension to explore both sides safely

### Middle School (6-8) | Ages 11-14

**Approach:** Center identity formation work as students navigate peer dynamics and the question "Who am I becoming?"

**Classroom Applications:**
- **Advisory Groups:** Explore BECOMING through identity tensions (fitting in/standing out)
- **Project-Based Learning:** Design projects around genuine community tensions
- **Peer Mediation:** Train students to facilitate tension-holding for each other

### High School (9-12) | Ages 14-18

**Approach:** Engage complex ethical discussions and prepare students for college, career, and citizenship through nuanced thinking.

**Classroom Applications:**
- **Humanities:** Analyze literature, history, and philosophy through polarity lenses
- **College Readiness:** Help students navigate competing pressures and future choices
- **Student Leadership:** Train student facilitators to lead workshops for peers

Educators from multiple districts connect for workshops, conferences, and professional development.

**Note:** All educator chapters require at least one CAI Tier 2 certified facilitator to ensure quality and support. See [Local Chapters Guide](local-chapters.md) for more information.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does training take?
Tier 1 takes 15-20 hours and can be completed over several weekends or a summer intensive. Tier 2 and 3 are more extensive commitments spread over months.

### Will I get PD credits?
Yes. CAI provides certificates documenting contact hours that qualify for CEUs in most states. We're also pursuing formal approval and university partnerships for graduate credit.

### Can I use this with my current curriculum?
Absolutely. Threads integrates with what you're already teaching—it's a lens for approaching any content, not a separate curriculum to add.

### What ages is this appropriate for?
All ages, K-12. The concepts adapt to any developmental stage with appropriate language and activities for each grade band.

### Do I need administrator approval?
Not necessarily for your own professional development, but we recommend sharing your learning with administrators—many schools want to expand once they see the impact.

### How much does it cost?
Pricing varies by training tier and whether you enroll individually or as a school cohort. Contact us for current rates and district partnership pricing.

### Is this aligned with standards?
Yes. Thread practice naturally aligns with SEL competencies, Common Core critical thinking standards, and most state learning standards. We provide mapping documents.

### What if I teach multiple grade levels?
You'll learn principles that apply across ages, plus specific adaptations for each grade band you work with. Many special area teachers find this especially valuable.
