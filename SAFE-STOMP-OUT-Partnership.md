# S.A.F.E. + STOMP OUT Bullying

**A campaign partnership: Crisis intervention meets daily capacity-building**

---

## The Vision

**STOMP OUT Bullying has reached 5.5 million students with awareness campaigns and crisis support.** S.A.F.E. offers what comes next: a daily, developmentally-appropriate framework that teaches elementary students how to hold tension *before* it becomes a crisis.

**Together, we create a complete system:** STOMP OUT Bullying handles awareness, advocacy, and crisis intervention at scale. S.A.F.E. provides the psychological foundation and daily practice framework that prevents conflicts from escalating to crisis—starting in kindergarten.

## The Critical Gap S.A.F.E. Fills for Elementary Students

**STOMP OUT Bullying's HelpChat starts at age 13.** But bullying patterns form in elementary school—between ages 5 and 11—when children first learn whether to collapse under tension or hold it. S.A.F.E. meets them there.

### ❌ What's Missing for K-5

- **No daily framework:** "Tell an adult" and "be an upstander" don't give kids steps for the 47 micro-conflicts per day
- **No developmental fit:** "Comebacks" require verbal sophistication 7-year-olds don't have
- **Reactive, not preventive:** Crisis support is vital, but what happens *before* crisis?
- **No psychological foundation:** Why does bullying happen? What tension is underneath?
- **Binary roles:** Victim (needs rescue) / Bully (needs punishment) / Upstander (needs courage)
- **No school-wide language:** Students learn in programs, but cafeteria staff, bus drivers, crossing guards don't speak the same language
- **No parent education:** How parents enable the cycle isn't addressed

### ✅ What S.A.F.E. Adds

- **Daily practice framework:** SEE. ASK. FEEL. EMERGE. works for every conflict (friend won't share, group excludes, someone says something mean)
- **Developmentally appropriate:** 5-year-olds can "See my stomach hurts" and "Feel I need space"
- **Preventive capacity-building:** Teach tension-holding before conflicts escalate to crisis
- **Threads foundation:** Understand the *why* (CONSENT, THRESHOLD, MEMORY tensions drive behavior)
- **Everyone's becoming:** Kid being hurt, kid doing harm, witness—all learning who they want to be
- **Universal school language:** Crossing guards to principal all use S.A.F.E. steps
- **Parent workshops:** How parents collapse and reinforce cycles—and how to hold tension instead

## How They Work Together: A Complete System

### The Partnership Model

**STOMP OUT Bullying: Awareness + Crisis Layer (Ages 13+)**
- Students know bullying is wrong (awareness campaigns)
- Students know where to get help (HelpChat, hotlines)
- Crisis intervention saves lives when situations escalate
- Inclusivity messaging reaches millions

**S.A.F.E.: Daily Capacity-Building Layer (Ages 5-11)**
- Students learn *how* to hold tension in everyday conflicts
- Students practice S.A.F.E. 10+ times per day (recess, cafeteria, classroom, bus)
- Preventive framework reduces conflicts that would escalate to crisis
- Psychological foundation: understand the *why* underneath behavior

**The Result:**
Elementary students build S.A.F.E. capacity daily → Middle/high school students access STOMP OUT crisis support when needed → Fewer students need crisis intervention because they learned tension-holding early.

## For Elementary Students: What Changes?

### Scenario: 2nd Grader Left Out at Recess

**STOMP OUT Bullying Approach:**
- "Tell a trusted adult"
- "Be an upstander—include them"
- Teacher intervenes, reminds class about kindness
- Awareness lesson on inclusion

**Limitation:** Student didn't learn *how* to navigate the tension of "I want to belong / They want their special friends." Next time, same collapse.

**S.A.F.E. Approach:**
- **SEE:** "I see I'm being left out. I see my stomach hurts."
- **ASK:** Teacher prompts: "Can you ask what they're playing and if you can join?" (not demand—ASK)
- **FEEL:** "What do you feel you need? A different group? Time alone? To try again?"
- **EMERGE:** "Who do you want to be? Someone who tries? Someone who finds a new group? Someone who tells the teacher what they need?"

**Result:** Student learns to hold the THRESHOLD tension (who belongs?) without collapsing into victim identity. Builds capacity for next time.

---

### Scenario: 4th Grader Calls Another Student a Name

**STOMP OUT Bullying Approach:**
- "That's bullying—stop immediately"
- Student sent to office (consequence)
- Victim receives support/counseling
- Bully receives education on kindness

**Limitation:** Binary framing (bad kid/hurt kid). Doesn't address *why* the name-calling happened or give student capacity to handle their feelings differently.

**S.A.F.E. Approach:**
- **SEE:** Teacher: "I see something hurtful just happened. What did you see?"
- **ASK (to name-caller):** "What were you feeling right before you said that?" (EMBODIMENT: body knows before brain)
- **FEEL:** "I felt angry because they were ignoring me" → "So you needed to be seen?"
- **EMERGE:** "When you need to be seen, who do you want to be? Someone who hurts to get attention, or someone who asks for what they need?"

**Result:** Student learns the tension underneath (PRESENCE: I need to be seen vs. I'm being ignored). Next time, different choice. *Consequences may still apply, but learning happens too.*

### Scenario: Kindergartener Witnesses Exclusion

**STOMP OUT Bullying Approach:**
- "Be an upstander—help your friend"
- "Tell the teacher what you saw"

**Limitation:** Abstract concept ("upstander") for 5-year-old. No concrete steps. Relies on adult intervention.

**S.A.F.E. Approach:**
- **SEE:** "I see someone being left out. I see I'm scared to help." (Honesty about their own fear)
- **ASK:** Teacher prompts: "Can you ask them if they want to play with you instead?" (Concrete action, within their capacity)
- **FEEL:** "What do you feel? Scared? Sad for them? Worried the group will leave you out too?" (Name the tension)
- **EMERGE:** "Who do you want to be? Someone who stays quiet, or someone who makes space?" (Age-appropriate identity choice)

**Result:** Kindergartener gets a concrete action (ask if they want to play) and language for their feelings. Practices becoming S.A.F.E.

## The Fundamental Philosophical Difference

### STOMP OUT Bullying Philosophy
**Problem-Solving Model**

- Bullying is a **problem** to solve
- Solutions: Awareness, reporting, crisis support, consequences
- Roles: Victim (needs protection), Bully (needs consequences), Upstander (needs courage)
- Goal: **Stop bullying behavior**
- When: **Reactive** (when bullying happens, respond)

### S.A.F.E. Philosophy
**Tension-Holding Model**

- Conflict is **tension** between competing needs
- Learning: Hold tension without collapsing into victim/aggressor
- Roles: Everyone's **becoming** (kid hurt, kid harming, witness, teacher—all learning)
- Goal: **Build capacity to emerge as who you want to be**
- When: **Preventive + daily** (every conflict is practice)

## What Elementary Schools Actually Need

### The Reality of Elementary Conflict

**Daily Conflict Count (Average Elementary Classroom):**
- **Recess:** 12-15 conflicts per 30-minute period (exclusion from games, "not it" arguments, accidental bumps interpreted as aggression)
- **Cafeteria:** 8-10 conflicts per lunch (table exclusion, food teasing, seat-saving disputes)
- **Classroom:** 10-12 conflicts per day (partner selection, sharing materials, perceived favoritism)
- **Bus/arrival/dismissal:** 5-8 conflicts per transition (line-cutting, seat disputes, backpack bumps)
- **Total:** **35-45 micro-conflicts per day**

**What Percentage Become "Bullying"?**
Research suggests **5-10% of conflicts escalate to repeated, intentional harm** (bullying). The other 90-95% are **conflict, tension, and social learning opportunities**.

**What Schools Need:**
- **For the 5-10% (bullying/crisis):** STOMP OUT Bullying's crisis support, reporting systems, awareness campaigns
- **For the 90-95% (daily conflict):** S.A.F.E.'s tension-holding framework, practiced 35-45 times per day

**The Gap:** Most anti-bullying programs focus on the 5-10%. S.A.F.E. addresses the 90-95%—and by doing so, prevents many conflicts from escalating to the 5-10%.

## Campaign Partnership: How This Could Work

### A Two-Layer System for Schools

#### Layer 1: S.A.F.E. Daily Practice (K-5)
- **Morning:** Crossing guards greet with "I SEE you today"
- **Classroom:** Teachers facilitate S.A.F.E. for daily conflicts
- **Recess:** Monitors prompt "Can you ASK what they need?"
- **Cafeteria:** Staff notice exclusion, prompt inclusion actions
- **Monthly:** S.A.F.E. assembly tracks actions, celebrates growth
- **Result:** Students build tension-holding capacity daily

#### Layer 2: STOMP OUT Bullying Awareness + Crisis (K-12)
- **Annual:** World Day of Bullying Prevention (Blue Shirt Day)
- **Awareness:** Posters, PSAs, inclusivity campaigns
- **Crisis:** HelpChat available for older students (13+)
- **Reporting:** Clear pathways for serious incidents
- **Advocacy:** LGBTQ+, racism, cyberbullying education
- **Result:** Students know where to get help when S.A.F.E. isn't enough

#### Integration Points:
- **Blue Shirt Day + S.A.F.E. Assembly:** STOMP OUT awareness campaign becomes S.A.F.E. celebration (count S.A.F.E. actions for the month)
- **HelpChat for Middle/High + S.A.F.E. Alumni:** Students who learned S.A.F.E. in elementary have language for their feelings when they call HelpChat
- **Wellness Rooms + S.A.F.E. Space:** Wellness rooms use S.A.F.E. framework for de-escalation
- **Youth Leaders + S.A.F.E. Training:** STOMP OUT's teen advocates learn S.A.F.E. to mentor elementary students

## How We Measure Success Together

### STOMP OUT Metrics
**Crisis Intervention:**
- HelpChat calls answered
- Lives saved (suicide prevention)
- Students reached via campaigns

**Awareness:**
- Schools participating in Blue Shirt Day
- Social media impressions
- Educator toolkits downloaded

### S.A.F.E. Metrics
**Daily Practice:**
- S.A.F.E. slips submitted (150+/month per school)
- Incident reports (track decline 40-60% year 1)
- Three action types: Inclusion, Witness/Ask, Self-Awareness

**Capacity-Building:**
- Teachers facilitating (vs. solving) conflicts
- Parents using S.A.F.E. language at home
- School-wide staff fluency in Threads

### Combined Impact
**What We'd See Together:**
- **Fewer crisis calls:** HelpChat calls from S.A.F.E. schools decline because students learned tension-holding early
- **Better awareness outcomes:** STOMP OUT campaigns land deeper because students have S.A.F.E. framework to apply them
- **K-12 continuity:** S.A.F.E. in elementary → STOMP OUT support in middle/high → full developmental coverage
- **Parent engagement:** S.A.F.E. parent workshops + STOMP OUT parent resources = comprehensive family education

## The Vision: A S.A.F.E. Generation

**Imagine a student's journey:**

**Kindergarten (Age 5):**
"I see someone being left out. I feel sad. I ask if they want to play."

**3rd Grade (Age 8):**
"I notice I want to say something mean because I feel ignored. I hold the PRESENCE tension: I need to be seen. Who do I want to be? I ask for what I need instead."

**5th Grade (Age 10):**
"My friend group is excluding someone. I feel the THRESHOLD tension: who belongs? I choose to make space even though it's uncomfortable. That's who I want to emerge as."

**7th Grade (Age 12):**
"I learned S.A.F.E. in elementary. Now when I see cyberbullying, I know how to hold the tension instead of collapsing. I still struggle sometimes, but I have language for it."

**10th Grade (Age 15):**
"When depression hit and I felt suicidal, I called STOMP OUT's HelpChat. They saved my life. I already knew how to name my feelings from S.A.F.E.—I just needed crisis support to get through."

**That's the partnership. That's the complete system.**
