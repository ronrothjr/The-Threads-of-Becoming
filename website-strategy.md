**Threads of Becoming**

**See. Hold. Emerge.**

*A framework for navigating creative tension—transforming what divides us into what advances us.*

Every person, every relationship, every organization is shaped by tension—between what is known and what is emerging, between who we've been and who we are becoming.

Most systems collapse under this pressure—forcing a resolution, picking a side, or breaking under the weight. Some learn to *hold* it.

Alfred North Whitehead observed that reality doesn't advance by eliminating opposites but by integrating them—what he called the 'creative advance into novelty.’

Many therapeutic and coaching modalities excel at specific interventions. Threads provides the navigational layer underneath—helping practitioners and clients recognize *where they are* in a tension before deciding *what to do* about it.

Rooted in Process Theology and Alfred North Whitehead's insight, Threads offers a universal framework for individuals, practitioners, and organizations who want to navigate complexity without losing themselves. 

We believe that opposing truths—held without collapse—become the birthplace of the genuinely new.

## **2\. Explore Threads**

### **What is Threads?**

Threads of Becoming is a **navigational framework**—not a personality system, not a therapy model, not a conflict mediation technique. It identifies seven universal tensions that shape human experience across every domain: personal growth, relationships, organizations, and communities.

Each Thread names a fundamental question we all face, and each holds two creative tensions that, when held open rather than collapsed into one pole, become the space where genuine transformation happens.

### **Philosophical Roots**

Threads is grounded in Process Theology and the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead, who observed that reality doesn't advance by eliminating opposites but by integrating them—what he called "the creative advance into novelty.” It advances through *creative integration*.

Threads applies this philosophical foundation to lived human experience. Every moment, every relationship, every organization faces opposing truths that demand recognition. The temptation is to collapse toward one pole—to choose safety over openness, action over reflection, continuity over change. But collapse doesn't resolve tension; it merely suppresses it—we lose access to the creative energy that tension provides.

**Threads teaches a different way:**   
*tension, held without collapse, becomes the birthplace of the genuinely new.*

### **The Three Movements: See. Hold. Emerge.**

The tagline isn't just a tagline—it's the protocol. The seven Threads organize into three movements that mirror how transformation actually works:

| Tagline | Movement | Threads | What Happens |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | ----- |
| **SEE** | Orienting | 1-4 | You locate where you are in the tension |
| **HOLD** | Sourcing | 5-6 | You receive what body and mystery know |
| **EMERGE** | Integrating | 7 | You become what's next |

**Orienting questions (1-4)** are incomplete—they trail off with ellipses because *you* must complete them. **Sourcing questions (5-6)** are direct and complete because body and mystery already hold the answers—you ask directly because they're already speaking. **The Integrating question (7)** contains its own tension: identity, process, and present moment held in a single question.

### **The Seven Threads**

Each thread represents a fundamental human tension with its own seed question and pair of polarities. Both poles carry truth; neither is the enemy.

| Thread | Seed Question | The Poles |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **PRESENCE** | *Where am I…?* | Within ↔ Between • Here ↔ Elsewhere |
| **CONSENT** | *What may I…?* | Yes ↔ No • Self ↔ Other |
| **MEMORY** | *Why do I…?* | Given ↔ Chosen • Telling ↔ Told |
| **PAUSE** | *When can I…?* | Not Yet ↔ Now • More ↔ Enough |
| **EMBODIMENT** | *How does my body know?* | Think ↔ Feel • Stay ↔ Go |
| **UNCERTAINTY** | *What is the mystery unveiling?* | Think ↔ Feel • Stay ↔ Go |
| **BECOMING** | *Who am I becoming?* | Same ↔ Different • Return ↔ Forward |

*Each Thread holds two creative tensions. Together they form a four-quadrant field for exploration—not a spectrum with a "healthy middle," but a living space where all positions carry wisdom.*

### **How Threads Works With Other Modalities**

Threads doesn't replace your existing training—it provides a navigational layer that enhances whatever approach you already use. Think of it as the *map* that helps you know where you are, while your modality provides the *vehicle* for getting somewhere.

**For IFS practitioners:** Parts work excels at working with internal multiplicity. Threads helps you recognize when a client is collapsing toward a protector or exile, and offers language for the meta-tension the parts are navigating.

**For EFT therapists:** The tango of attachment needs its own rhythm. Threads names the tensions couples cycle through and helps identify which Thread is activated when the dance stalls.

**For NVC practitioners:** Needs and feelings are the content. Threads provides the structural awareness of which universal tension is making those needs feel incompatible.

**For Enneagram coaches:** Type reveals patterns. Threads helps clients hold the tension between their type's gifts and growth edges without collapsing into self-criticism or spiritual bypass.

**For mediators:** Resolution has its place. Threads offers a framework for those moments when resolution isn't yet possible—when the work is holding the tension long enough for something genuinely new to emerge.

**For Bowen systems therapists:** Differentiation is itself a creative tension between connection and autonomy. Threads provides shared vocabulary for the universal dynamics underneath family-specific patterns.

The Framework Crosswalk in our practitioner materials maps Threads concepts to IFS, EFT, NVC, Bowen, ACT, and other modalities—showing how the same territory is named differently across traditions.

## **5\. For Faith Communities**

### **Threads for Congregations**

Congregations are communities of meaning-making—and that makes them natural sites of creative tension. Between tradition and innovation. Between pastoral care and prophetic witness. Between individual needs and collective mission.

Threads offers congregations a shared language for navigating these tensions without splitting, scapegoating, or burning out. Developed and tested in Unitarian Universalist communities, the framework is applicable across faith traditions.

* **Leadership Retreats** — Full-day sessions for boards, committees, staff  
* **Right Relations Teams** — Training for congregational conflict transformation  
* **Discernment Circles** — Facilitated processes for major decisions  
* **Clergy Formation** — Integration with ministerial practice

## **6\. Mission & Philosophical Roots**

### **Our Mission**

*To cultivate the human capacity to hold creative tension—so individuals, communities, and organizations can move from collapse toward emergence.*

### **Where Threads Came From**

Threads of Becoming emerged from the intersection of congregational leadership, Process Theology, and the practical demands of helping people navigate tensions they couldn't resolve. Working with a Unitarian Universalist congregation's Right Relations Team, Ron Bronson found that existing conflict resolution models often pushed too quickly toward resolution—missing the transformative potential that lives in tension itself.

Over seven months of intensive development—drawing on Whitehead's philosophy, clinical frameworks, and lived practice—the seven Threads crystallized as universal dynamics that appear across personal, relational, and organizational life. The framework has since been tested in workshops, pastoral care, leadership retreats, and one-on-one sessions. It continues to evolve through the practitioners who use it.

### **What We Believe**

* Tension is not the enemy—it is the birthplace of the genuinely new.  
* Collapse is not failure—it is information about what we're avoiding.  
* Growth requires holding what we once fled.  
* Ethical, skilled presence can transform systems.  
* People deserve tools for clarity, compassion, and emergence.  
* The best practitioners integrate multiple approaches—Threads provides the navigational substrate.

### **Why "Creative Advance"?**

The name comes from Alfred North Whitehead's concept of the "creative advance into novelty"—the idea that reality itself moves forward through the integration of what has been with what is becoming. We are not problems to be solved but tensions to be lived. The Creative Advance Institute exists to help people and organizations participate more skillfully in this ongoing process of becoming.
