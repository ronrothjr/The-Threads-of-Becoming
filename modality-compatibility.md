# **THREADS OF BECOMING**

Modality Compatibility Reference

*How Threads Integrates with Established Therapeutic and Developmental Frameworks*

# **The Core Principle**

Threads of Becoming is a diagnostic and conceptual lens, not a replacement for established modalities. It answers a question most frameworks don't address: *What do we do when both sides are legitimate, both are heard, and the tension still can't be resolved?*

Most therapeutic approaches aim to resolve tension through understanding, skill-building, or processing. Threads provides architecture for navigating tensions that remain after resolution has been attempted—the permanent polarities that require ongoing navigation rather than solution.

# **Quick Reference: All Modalities**

| Modality | Core Question | Thread Alignment | Fit | Key Distinction | Integration Point |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Nonviolent Communication (NVC)** | How do we communicate so needs can be heard and met? | All threads (needs underlie all tensions) | High | NVC resolves through understanding; Threads navigates when understanding doesn't resolve | Use NVC to clarify what each pole needs; use Threads when clarity doesn't resolve tension |
| **Polarity Management** | How do we manage ongoing organizational polarities? | All threads (surface expressions) | High | Polarity maps specific tensions; Threads claims universal architecture beneath all polarities | Use Polarity tools for organizational mapping; use Threads for deeper structure and emergence |
| **Internal Family Systems (IFS)** | How does the Self unblend from parts to heal the system? | PRESENCE, CONSENT, MEMORY, BECOMING | High | IFS works with parts; Threads names what parts are organized around | Use Threads to identify active tension; use IFS to work with parts polarized around it |
| **Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)** | How do couples access attachment emotions and reshape cycles? | PRESENCE, CONSENT, MEMORY | High | EFT provides choreography for softening; Threads explains why softening happens | Map cycles to threads; use EFT techniques; track emergence as softening occurs |
| **Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT)** | How do we increase psychological flexibility for valued living? | MEMORY, PRESENCE, EMBODIMENT, BECOMING, PAUSE | Very High | ACT cultivates flexibility processes; Threads maps the territory those processes navigate | Use Threads to diagnose stuck flexibility; apply ACT techniques; extend into relational domains |
| **Somatic/Trauma Approaches** | How does the body complete what was interrupted and restore regulation? | EMBODIMENT (primary) | High | Somatic approaches provide therapeutic technique; Threads names the thread, not the method | Use Threads to identify EMBODIMENT activation; use somatic tools for actual processing |
| **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)** | How do we build skills for distress tolerance and dialectical thinking? | All threads (explicitly dialectical) | Very High | DBT provides skills curriculum for severe collapse; Threads provides universal architecture | Use DBT skills for high-acuity clients; use Threads for underlying map of dialectics |
| **Gottman Method** | What behaviors predict relationship success, and how do we build them? | PRESENCE, CONSENT, MEMORY, PAUSE | High | Gottman is behavioral and empirical; Threads explains why perpetual problems are perpetual | Use Gottman for friendship/repair skills; use Threads for gridlocked perpetual problems |
| **Bowen Family Systems** | How does differentiation allow connection without fusion or cutoff? | PRESENCE, CONSENT, MEMORY | Very High | Differentiation IS holding PRESENCE and CONSENT; multigenerational patterns ARE MEMORY | Use Bowen for family mapping; use Threads to name tensions being transmitted |
| **Narrative Therapy** | How do we re-author lives from problem-saturated to preferred stories? | MEMORY (primary), BECOMING | High | Narrative provides externalization technique; Threads ensures both Given and Chosen honored | Use Narrative for re-authoring methodology; use Threads to prevent collapse into Chosen pole |
| **Mindfulness (MBSR/MBCT)** | How do we cultivate present-moment, non-judgmental awareness? | PRESENCE, EMBODIMENT, PAUSE | High | Mindfulness builds capacity to notice; Threads provides map of what you're noticing | Use mindfulness as prerequisite skill; use Threads to direct awareness toward specific tensions |
| **Motivational Interviewing (MI)** | How do we help people resolve ambivalence toward valued change? | BECOMING, PAUSE, CONSENT | High | MI has direction (toward change); Threads is non-directional about which pole is right | MI spirit IS Threads stance; use MI for behavioral change; use Threads for existential ambivalence |
| **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** | How do we modify distorted thoughts and maladaptive behaviors? | MEMORY, PAUSE, UNCERTAINTY, EMBODIMENT | Moderate | CBT corrects 'distortion'; Threads honors both poles as carrying wisdom | Use CBT skills for severe collapse; use Threads to understand what collapse protected |
| **Focusing (Gendlin)** | How do we access the felt sense and allow it to unfold into meaning? | EMBODIMENT (primary), PAUSE, UNCERTAINTY | Very High | Focusing provides deep EMBODIMENT methodology; Threads maps broader territory | Use Focusing when EMBODIMENT is activated; body shift IS emergence |

# **Compatibility Levels Explained**

**Very High:** Deep philosophical alignment. Frameworks share core assumptions. Integration is natural and mutually enriching. Examples: ACT, DBT, Bowen, Focusing.

**High:** Compatible worldviews. Threads adds diagnostic precision without contradicting the modality's core claims. Examples: IFS, EFT, Gottman, NVC, Narrative, Mindfulness, MI, Somatic approaches.

**Moderate:** Philosophical tension exists. Techniques can be integrated pragmatically, but core assumptions differ. Threads asks different questions. Example: CBT.

# **What Threads DOES Provide: Personal Practice**

Threads includes a Personal Practice Workbook—a skills curriculum for individuals navigating their own tensions. This teaches:

• Thread recognition (which tension is active in my life right now?)

• Collapse identification (which pole am I avoiding? what is it protecting?)

• Tension holding (staying present without forcing resolution)

• Emergence awareness (noticing when something new arises)

*Threads has both a facilitator training pathway AND a personal practice pathway. The facilitator training teaches practitioners to guide others. The personal practice teaches individuals to navigate their own lives.*

# **What Threads Does NOT Provide**

Threads is enhancement, not replacement. It does not provide:

• Clinical licensure or expanded scope of practice

• Permission to diagnose or treat mental health conditions

• Trauma processing protocols (refer to SE, EMDR, Sensorimotor)

• Crisis intervention skills (use DBT's TIPP, distress tolerance modules)

• Behavioral repair sequences (use Gottman's repair checklists, antidotes)

• Parts work methodology (use IFS unburdening protocols)

• Evidence base (that's what we're building)

# **Clinical Decision Tree**

*When to use Threads alongside other modalities:*

**If the problem is unmet needs that could be met with better communication →** NVC

**If the problem is internal parts in conflict →** IFS (Threads identifies which tension parts organize around)

**If the problem is attachment injury in couples →** EFT (Threads maps the cycle to universal tensions)

**If the problem is psychological inflexibility →** ACT (Threads shows which tension flexibility is stuck around)

**If the problem is trauma stored in the body →** Somatic approaches (Threads identifies EMBODIMENT; refer for processing)

**If the problem is severe emotion dysregulation →** DBT (Threads provides architecture; DBT provides skills)

**If the problem is negative couple interaction cycles →** Gottman (Threads explains perpetual problems)

**If the problem is multigenerational patterns →** Bowen (Threads names which tensions are transmitted)

**If the problem is a problem-saturated story →** Narrative Therapy (Threads ensures both Given and Chosen are honored)

**If the problem is reactivity and lack of awareness →** Mindfulness (prerequisite for all Threads work)

**If the problem is ambivalence about specific behavior change →** MI (Threads addresses existential ambivalence)

**If the problem is cognitive distortions causing acute symptoms →** CBT (Threads asks what collapse protected)

**If the problem is disconnection from body wisdom →** Focusing (deep EMBODIMENT methodology)

**If the problem is a permanent polarity that keeps returning →** *This is Threads' home territory*

# **The Honest Positioning**

Threads is not better than these modalities. Threads does something different. It provides architecture for understanding what all these approaches are navigating—and offers a framework for the tensions that remain after resolution has been attempted.

Use the modality that fits the presenting problem. Use Threads to understand the territory. Let each inform the other.

Version 1.0

**My question now and the question many will ask is "why are you doing this when NVC is better and already has the global reach to make a difference?”**

Because NVC and Threads solve different problems.

**NVC asks:** "How do we communicate so our needs can be heard and potentially met?"

**Threads asks:** "What do we do when both needs are legitimate, both are being heard, and the tension still can't be resolved?"

NVC is brilliant for its problem. Observation, feeling, need, request—that sequence cuts through so much defensive noise. When conflict comes from miscommunication, unheard needs, jackal-eared listening, NVC transforms it.

But NVC has an implicit assumption: *if we understand each other's needs clearly enough, we can find a way forward.* Often true. Not always.

**Where NVC hits its limit:**

Maria needs connection. James needs solitude. They've done the NVC work. They hear each other perfectly. They're not speaking jackal. They genuinely understand. And *the tension remains* because both needs are real, both are legitimate, and meeting one fully means not meeting the other fully.

NVC doesn't have a framework for "this tension is permanent and generative." It's oriented toward resolution through understanding. Threads is oriented toward navigation through holding.

**They're complementary, not competing:**

* Use NVC to get clear on what each pole is actually asking for  
* Use Threads when clarity doesn't resolve the tension—when the problem isn't misunderstanding but genuine polarity

**The honest positioning:**

"NVC is better at what NVC does. Threads does something NVC doesn't attempt. If your conflict is about unmet needs that could be met with better communication, NVC is your tool. If your conflict is about structural tensions that keep returning no matter how well you communicate, Threads offers something NVC doesn't."

That's not competition. That's different tools for different problems. Does that framing hold for you?

**Yes, it does. I'm wondering about the other modalities. Let's do the same with them, one by one. Then I want to provide a modality compatibility chart for easy reference.**

Let's do it. I'll take them one at a time so you can push back or refine as we go.

Let's do it. I'll take them one at a time so you can push back or refine as we go.

**Polarity Management (Barry Johnson)**

This is the most obvious comparison—and the one where you need the sharpest differentiation.

**Polarity Management asks:** "How do we identify and manage ongoing polarities in organizations so we don't over-correct between extremes?"

**Threads asks:** "What are the universal tensions that underlie *all* polarities, and how do we hold them in a way that produces emergence—not just balance?"

**Where they overlap:**

Both recognize that some tensions can't be resolved, only navigated. Both use pole-mapping. Both identify the downsides of over-focusing on one pole. Johnson's infinity loop (the benefits of each pole, the fears of the other) is genuinely useful diagnostic work.

**Where Threads goes further:**

1. *Universal structure.* Johnson treats each polarity as unique to its context. Centralization vs. Decentralization is a polarity; so is Stability vs. Change. Threads claims these are *surface expressions* of deeper universal tensions (CONSENT, BECOMING). The seven threads are generative categories, not just examples.

2. *Embodiment and emergence.* Polarity Management is cognitive—mapping, analyzing, planning. Threads insists transformation happens in the body, and that holding tension produces something genuinely *new*, not just oscillation management.

3. *Individual and relational scope.* Polarity Management is primarily organizational. Threads works at individual, dyadic, group, and organizational levels with the same architecture.

4. *Philosophical grounding.* Johnson's work is pragmatic and atheoretical. Threads is grounded in process philosophy—the claim that reality *is* becoming, and that creative tension is how novelty enters the world.

**The honest positioning:**

"Polarity Management is excellent for what it does—helping organizations identify and manage recurring either/or traps. Threads offers a deeper architecture: the claim that all polarities are expressions of a smaller set of universal tensions, and that holding those tensions produces emergence, not just balance. If you want to map a specific organizational polarity, Johnson's tools are precise. If you want to understand why the *same* tensions keep appearing in different forms—and how to facilitate genuine transformation rather than managed oscillation—Threads goes further."

**Internal Family Systems (IFS)**

**IFS asks:** "How do we help the Self unblend from protective parts so the whole system can heal?"

**Threads asks:** "What universal tensions are the parts organized around, and how do we hold those tensions so something new can emerge?"

**Where they overlap:**

Both share a fundamental stance—curiosity over pathology, both/and over either/or. Both trust that wisdom emerges when we stop trying to fix. The Self energy IFS cultivates mirrors the "holding" stance Threads describes. Neither framework pathologizes the poles people collapse toward—they honor protective function.

**Where they differ:**

1. *Unit of analysis.* IFS works with parts—internal sub-personalities with their own histories, fears, and intentions. Threads works with tensions—the poles that parts organize around. A manager in IFS might be collapsed toward the WITHIN pole of PRESENCE. A firefighter might be collapsed toward NOW in PAUSE. Threads names what the parts are *about*.

2. *Mechanism of change.* IFS heals through unburdening—witnessing exiles, releasing what they carry, updating the system. Threads transforms through holding—staying in tension long enough for emergence. These aren't contradictory; they're different leverage points.

3. *Scope.* IFS is primarily intrapsychic (though it extends to relationships). Threads works at individual, dyadic, group, and organizational levels with the same architecture. The same seven tensions appear at every scale.

4. *Diagnostic vs. therapeutic.* Threads is explicitly a diagnostic and conceptual lens, not a therapy. IFS is a complete therapeutic modality with specific protocols for working with parts.

**The integration:**

* Use Threads to identify which existential tension is activated  
* Use IFS to work with the parts polarized around that tension  
* Track emergence as unburdening allows the system to hold both poles

**The honest positioning:**

"IFS is a complete therapeutic system for working with internal parts. Threads doesn't replace it—Threads names what the parts are organized *around*. When you see a protector, Threads asks: which universal tension is this part guarding? When unburdening happens, Threads predicts what emerges: the capacity to hold both poles. Use IFS for the therapeutic work. Use Threads to understand the architecture of the tensions the parts are navigating."

**Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)**

**EFT asks:** "How do we help couples access primary attachment emotions and reshape negative interaction cycles so they can form secure bonds?"

**Threads asks:** "What universal tensions are driving the cycle, and how do we help both partners see they're holding opposite poles of the same thread?"

**Where they overlap:**

The pursue-withdraw cycle EFT identifies is a perfect example of partners collapsed toward opposite poles—one in BETWEEN (pursuing connection), one in WITHIN (protecting through distance). Both frameworks see the cycle as the enemy, not either partner. Both aim for something to shift that allows the system to move differently.

**Where they differ:**

1. *Attachment focus.* EFT is rooted in attachment theory—the cycle is driven by attachment fears, and healing comes through creating corrective emotional experiences that reshape attachment security. Threads is agnostic about attachment as the root cause. The PRESENCE thread includes attachment dynamics but isn't reducible to them.

2. *Emotional processing.* EFT's power is in accessing primary emotions beneath reactive positions—the fear under the anger, the loneliness under the withdrawal. Threads doesn't have a mechanism for emotional deepening. It names the tension but doesn't provide the therapeutic moves to access what's underneath.

3. *The softening event.* EFT's signature moment—when the withdrawer reaches or the pursuer softens—is emergence in Threads language. But EFT has a specific protocol for creating conditions for that moment. Threads names what's happening; EFT provides the how.

4. *Scope.* EFT is primarily for couples (with extensions to families and individuals). Threads works across all relational scales.

**The integration:**

* Map the couple's negative cycle to threads (often PRESENCE, CONSENT, or MEMORY)  
* Help each partner see they're collapsed toward opposite poles of the same tension  
* Use EFT techniques to access primary emotions and create softening  
* Threads explains *why* softening happens (emergence from held tension) and helps name what's shifting

**The honest positioning:**

"EFT is the gold standard for couples therapy grounded in attachment. Threads doesn't replace it. Threads provides a diagnostic overlay that can sharpen cycle identification—naming not just 'pursue-withdraw' but which universal tension is driving it. When the softening event happens, Threads gives language for what emerged. Use EFT for the therapeutic choreography. Use Threads to name the architecture of what's being transformed."

**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)**

**ACT asks:** "How do we increase psychological flexibility so people can move toward valued living even in the presence of difficult thoughts and feelings?"

**Threads asks:** "What universal tensions are people stuck in, and how do we hold them so something new can emerge?"

**Where they overlap:**

The overlap is remarkable. ACT's hexaflex maps onto Threads almost point by point:

* *Cognitive defusion* is MEMORY movement—from Told (fused with story) to Telling (authoring)  
* *Present-moment awareness* is PRESENCE—cultivating the Within pole, grounded here  
* *Acceptance* is EMBODIMENT—making room for Feel without flooding or dissociating  
* *Self-as-context* is BECOMING—the observer self that persists through change (Same) while allowing transformation (Different)  
* *Values clarification* is BECOMING—distinguishing what endures from inherited "shoulds"  
* *Committed action* is PAUSE—moving from Not Yet into Now, aligned with values

Both frameworks are non-pathologizing. Both treat "stuckness" as inflexibility rather than brokenness. Both aim for a quality of being that can hold difficulty without being controlled by it.

**Where they differ:**

1. *Individual vs. relational scope.* ACT is primarily individual (though it's been extended relationally). Threads applies the same architecture to dyads, teams, organizations, and communities. The couple stuck in pursue-withdraw, the board deadlocked between expansion and consolidation—Threads has vocabulary for these. ACT would need extension.

2. *Flexibility vs. emergence.* ACT aims for flexibility—the capacity to respond adaptively rather than reactively. Threads aims for emergence—something genuinely new arising that neither pole could produce alone. Flexibility is necessary for emergence, but emergence is a stronger claim.

3. *Process vs. structure.* ACT identifies six processes that constitute flexibility. Threads identifies seven tensions that underlie human experience. ACT tells you *what to cultivate*. Threads tells you *what you're navigating*. ACT is more prescriptive; Threads is more diagnostic.

4. *Behavioral roots.* ACT comes from behavioral psychology and Relational Frame Theory. It's empirically grounded with substantial research support. Threads comes from process philosophy and has theoretical coherence but not yet empirical validation.

**The integration:**

* Use Threads to diagnose which flexibility process is stuck (and which thread underlies it)  
* Apply ACT techniques for that specific inflexibility pattern  
* Threads extends ACT into relational and systemic dimensions that ACT's individual focus may miss  
* ACT provides the evidence base and specific protocols; Threads provides the meta-architecture

**The honest positioning:**

"ACT is a well-researched, highly effective approach to psychological flexibility. Threads doesn't compete with it—Threads provides an underlying map that shows *what* people are becoming flexible about. The six processes ACT cultivates are movements within the seven threads Threads identifies. Use ACT for the interventions. Use Threads to understand the territory those interventions navigate—and to extend the work into relational and systemic contexts where ACT's individual focus may not reach."

**Somatic & Trauma-Informed Approaches (Somatic Experiencing, Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, EMDR)**

**These approaches ask:** "How do we help the body complete what was interrupted, process what was overwhelming, and restore regulation to the nervous system?"

**Threads asks:** "What universal tensions is the body holding, and how do we create conditions for the body to hold both poles without collapsing?"

**Where they overlap:**

The EMBODIMENT thread is explicitly somatic—the tension between Think and Feel, Stay and Go. Collapse in this thread mirrors dysregulation patterns that trauma therapists work with daily:

* *Dissociation* is EMBODIMENT collapse into Think—protective distance from overwhelming sensation  
* *Flooding* is EMBODIMENT collapse into Feel—overwhelmed without cognitive container  
* *Freeze* is collapse into Stay when Go is needed  
* *Flight* is collapse into Go when Stay is needed

The window of tolerance concept maps directly to capacity to hold both poles. Pendulation—the titrated movement between activation and resource—is movement between poles to expand capacity.

**Where they differ:**

1. *Mechanism of healing.* Somatic approaches work with the body directly—completing defensive responses, discharging trapped activation, restoring the body's innate capacity to regulate. Threads names the territory but doesn't provide the therapeutic techniques. You can't "hold the EMBODIMENT tension" with a client in flashback. You need the somatic tools.

2. *Trauma-specific focus.* These modalities are designed for trauma—they have protocols for titration, resourcing, processing traumatic memory. Threads is not a trauma modality. It names the thread that trauma work addresses, but it doesn't provide the safety architecture that trauma processing requires.

3. *Nervous system as primary.* Somatic approaches center the autonomic nervous system—sympathetic activation, dorsal vagal shutdown, ventral vagal safety. Threads includes the body but doesn't privilege neurobiological mechanisms. Polyvagal theory gives these approaches explanatory power Threads doesn't offer.

4. *The dual awareness goal.* Somatic Experiencing and Sensorimotor Psychotherapy aim for dual awareness—the capacity to feel sensation while maintaining observer perspective. This *is* holding both poles of EMBODIMENT (Think and Feel, Stay and Go simultaneously). The goal is the same; the somatic approaches provide the method.

**The integration:**

* Use Threads to identify when EMBODIMENT is the activated thread  
* Recognize collapse patterns: dissociation (Think), flooding (Feel), freeze (Stay), flight (Go)  
* Use somatic techniques to work with the body directly  
* Track emergence as the window of tolerance expands—the client can hold both poles longer

**The critical caution:**

Threads is NOT a trauma processing protocol. The EMBODIMENT protocol in your materials explicitly says: "The body is not always safe to enter." For trauma survivors, approaching the body can trigger overwhelm. Somatic approaches have the titration skills, the resourcing protocols, the clinical judgment to navigate that safely. Threads practitioners without trauma training should recognize EMBODIMENT activation and refer appropriately.

**The honest positioning:**

"Somatic and trauma-informed approaches are clinical modalities for working with the body and healing trauma. Threads doesn't replace them—Threads names the thread they work within. EMBODIMENT is what these approaches address; they provide the *how*. Use Threads to recognize when the body is the entry point. Use somatic modalities for the actual therapeutic work. And know your limits: if trauma is present, refer to those trained to work with it safely."

**Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)**

**DBT asks:** "How do we help people—especially those with emotion dysregulation and suicidal behaviors—build skills to tolerate distress, regulate emotions, navigate relationships, and hold dialectical tensions?"

**Threads asks:** "What universal tensions are people stuck in, and how do we hold them so something new can emerge?"

**Where they overlap:**

This is the closest philosophical alignment of any modality. Linehan built DBT explicitly on dialectics—the synthesis of opposites. Her core dialectic (acceptance AND change) is the engine of the whole approach.

* *Wise Mind* is the synthesis of Emotion Mind and Reasonable Mind—holding EMBODIMENT's Think and Feel poles simultaneously  
* *Walking the Middle Path* is explicit polarity navigation—teaching clients to find the synthesis between extremes  
* *Distress Tolerance* is the capacity to hold tension without collapsing into impulsive action—PAUSE (staying in Not Yet when Now feels unbearable)  
* *Radical Acceptance* is MEMORY work—accepting the Given without being imprisoned by it  
* *Interpersonal Effectiveness* navigates CONSENT—DEAR MAN, GIVE, FAST are tools for the Yes/No, Self/Other tensions

Both frameworks are explicitly dialectical. Both reject either/or thinking. Both see the ability to hold opposites as the mark of health.

**Where they differ:**

1. *Population specificity.* DBT was designed for borderline personality disorder and high-risk clients—people whose collapse patterns are severe and sometimes lethal. The skills are calibrated for that intensity. Threads is designed for universal human tensions across populations.

2. *Skills vs. diagnosis.* DBT is a skills-training protocol. It teaches specific, learnable techniques: TIPP for crisis, opposite action for emotion regulation, DEAR MAN for requests. Threads is diagnostic—it names the tension but doesn't provide the skills curriculum.

3. *The synthesis goal.* DBT explicitly aims for synthesis—Wise Mind *is* the integration of opposites. Threads aims for emergence—something genuinely new that transcends both poles. Synthesis suggests combining what exists; emergence suggests something arising that didn't exist before. This is a subtle but real difference.

4. *Therapeutic structure.* DBT has a highly structured delivery: individual therapy, skills group, phone coaching, consultation team. It's a comprehensive treatment package. Threads is a framework that can be integrated into various delivery structures.

5. *Evidence base.* DBT has decades of research, including RCTs for suicidality, self-harm, and borderline personality. It's one of the most empirically validated treatments. Threads has theoretical coherence but no outcome data yet.

**The integration:**

* Threads provides the underlying map of what DBT's dialectics are navigating  
* DBT provides the skills curriculum for high-acuity clients who collapse severely  
* Use Threads to identify which thread is activated; use DBT skills for that domain  
* For clients who need distress tolerance before they can hold tension, DBT skills build the capacity Threads work requires

**The honest positioning:**

"DBT is the gold standard for dialectical work with high-acuity clients. Its skills curriculum is unmatched for helping people who collapse severely—into suicidality, self-harm, impulsive destruction. Threads doesn't replace DBT. Threads offers a universal architecture that shows *what* the dialectics are about. The seven threads name the territory; DBT provides the skills for navigating that territory when the stakes are highest. For general populations, Threads may be sufficient. For clients who need DBT-level structure, use DBT—and let Threads inform which dialectics you're working."

**Gottman Method**

**Gottman asks:** "What behaviors predict relationship success or failure, and how do we help couples build the skills and friendship that sustain lasting love?"

**Threads asks:** "What universal tensions are the couple navigating, and how do we help them hold those tensions so something new can emerge?"

**Where they overlap:**

Gottman's research identified patterns that map recognizably onto threads:

* *The Four Horsemen* (criticism, contempt, defensiveness, stonewalling) are collapse behaviors—ways couples stop holding tension and attack or withdraw instead  
* *Perpetual problems* (69% of couple conflicts) are Gottman's term for what Threads calls unresolvable tensions. He found most conflicts can't be solved, only managed. This is core Threads territory.  
* *Gridlocked vs. dialogue* — Gottman distinguishes couples who are stuck on perpetual problems versus those who can discuss them with humor and acceptance. That's the difference between collapsed and held tension.  
* *Repair attempts* are moves back toward the tension after collapse—exactly what the Threads collapse-recovery cycle describes  
* *Dreams within conflict* — Gottman's intervention for gridlock asks: what dream or need underlies your position? This surfaces the legitimate concern each pole is protecting—Threads language exactly.

**Where they differ:**

1. *Empirical vs. philosophical foundation.* Gottman built his method from observational research—coding thousands of couple interactions, tracking outcomes over decades. He knows what predicts divorce with 90%+ accuracy. Threads is built from process philosophy and clinical observation, not longitudinal research.

2. *Behavioral focus.* Gottman is fundamentally behavioral. Turn toward or turn away. Ratio of positive to negative interactions (5:1). Specific repair phrases. Concrete skills. Threads is more architectural—it names the tension but doesn't prescribe the behavioral repair sequences.

3. *Friendship and fondness.* Gottman emphasizes the friendship system—love maps, fondness and admiration, turning toward. This isn't about navigating tension; it's about building the relational capital that makes tension-navigation possible. Threads doesn't have a friendship-building component.

4. *The Sound Relationship House.* Gottman's full model includes trust, commitment, shared meaning—a comprehensive architecture for relationship health. Threads focuses specifically on tension navigation, not the full ecology of relationship.

5. *The Four Horsemen as diagnostics.* Gottman's Horsemen tell you *how* collapse is manifesting behaviorally (criticism, contempt, defensiveness, stonewalling). Threads tells you *what* tension is being collapsed. They diagnose at different levels.

**The integration:**

* Use Gottman's Horsemen to recognize collapse behavior in real-time  
* Use Threads to identify which thread is being collapsed  
* Use Gottman's repair and friendship interventions to rebuild capacity  
* For perpetual problems, use Threads' framing: "This isn't a problem to solve. What would it look like to hold this together?"  
* The Dreams Within Conflict intervention is Threads-compatible—surface what each pole is protecting, honor both

**The honest positioning:**

"Gottman Method is the most empirically grounded couples approach available. Decades of research tell us what behaviors predict success and failure. Threads doesn't replace that evidence base. What Threads adds is a framework for understanding *why* perpetual problems are perpetual—they're expressions of universal tensions that can't be resolved, only navigated. Gottman gives you the behavioral interventions. Threads gives you the architecture of what you're intervening on. Use Gottman's skills for building friendship and making repair. Use Threads when couples hit gridlock on perpetual problems and need to shift from solving to holding."

**Family Systems / Bowen Theory**

**Bowen asks:** "How do we understand the multigenerational emotional processes that shape individual functioning, and how does differentiation of self allow people to be both connected and autonomous?"

**Threads asks:** "What universal tensions are being transmitted across generations and activated in relational systems, and how do we hold them so something new can emerge?"

**Where they overlap:**

The overlap is deep. Bowen might be the most naturally Threads-compatible modality.

* *Differentiation of self* is the capacity to hold PRESENCE (Within AND Between) and CONSENT (Self AND Other) simultaneously—staying connected without losing yourself, maintaining self without cutting off. Differentiation IS holding these tensions without collapse.  
* *Triangulation* is what happens when a dyad can't hold tension—they recruit a third party to diffuse it. This is collapse at the system level.  
* *Multigenerational transmission* is the MEMORY thread across generations—patterns Given that become invisible operating systems. The family's unfinished business becomes the child's inheritance.  
* *Emotional cutoff* is PRESENCE collapse toward Within and MEMORY collapse toward Chosen (cutting off from the Given). Bowen saw cutoff as pseudo-differentiation—it looks like autonomy but it's reactivity.  
* *Family projection process* is how parents transmit their undifferentiation to children—their collapsed patterns become the child's collapsed patterns.  
* *Nuclear family emotional process* describes the four patterns anxious families use: marital conflict, dysfunction in one spouse, impairment in one child, emotional distance. These are all collapse patterns.

**Where they differ:**

1. *Anxiety as engine.* Bowen centers chronic anxiety as the driver of family dysfunction. When anxiety rises, differentiation drops, and people collapse into fusion or cutoff. Threads doesn't privilege anxiety as the root cause—it names tension as fundamental, with collapse happening for many reasons.

2. *Differentiation as goal.* Bowen's singular aim is differentiation—the capacity to be a self while staying connected. Threads has a broader frame: seven tensions, each with its own navigation. Differentiation is crucial for PRESENCE and CONSENT but doesn't directly address PAUSE, UNCERTAINTY, or BECOMING.

3. *The multigenerational focus.* Bowen goes deep into family-of-origin work—genograms, coaching clients to return to their families, detriangulating across generations. Threads names MEMORY as a thread but doesn't provide the specific multigenerational methodology.

4. *Systems vs. tensions.* Bowen thinks in systems—the family as an emotional unit, homeostasis, feedback loops. Threads thinks in tensions—poles that can be held or collapsed. Both are relational, but the conceptual architecture differs.

5. *Coaching modality.* Bowen work is often done through coaching rather than therapy—the practitioner helps the client understand their family system and plan differentiation moves. This is compatible with Threads' non-clinical positioning.

**The integration:**

* Use Bowen to map the multigenerational system—who triangulates with whom, where cutoff has occurred, how anxiety moves through the family  
* Use Threads to name which tensions are being transmitted and collapsed  
* Differentiation work IS Threads work on PRESENCE and CONSENT  
* MEMORY thread work can be informed by genogram findings—what stories were Given, what authorship is now possible  
* When clients are working on family-of-origin, Threads provides language for what they're navigating; Bowen provides the methodology

**The honest positioning:**

"Bowen Theory is the foundation of family systems thinking. Its concepts—differentiation, triangulation, multigenerational transmission—remain essential for understanding how families function. Threads doesn't replace Bowen; Threads provides a complementary lens. Differentiation *is* the capacity to hold PRESENCE and CONSENT without collapsing. Multigenerational transmission *is* the MEMORY thread operating across generations. Use Bowen for the family systems mapping and the differentiation coaching methodology. Use Threads to name the specific tensions being transmitted and to extend the work beyond family-of-origin into other relational contexts."

**Narrative Therapy**

**Narrative Therapy asks:** "How do we help people separate from problem-saturated stories, recover their agency as authors, and re-author their lives toward preferred identities?"

**Threads asks:** "What universal tensions are people stuck in, and how do we hold them so something new can emerge?"

**Where they overlap:**

The MEMORY thread (Given/Chosen, Telling/Told) is Narrative Therapy's home territory.

* *Externalization* — "The problem is the problem, not the person" — creates distance between the person and their story. This is movement from Told (possessed by the narrative) toward Telling (authoring relationship to it).  
* *Unique outcomes* — moments when the problem didn't dominate — are evidence that the Given story isn't the whole story. They open space for Chosen narrative.  
* *Re-authoring* is explicit movement along the Telling/Told axis—from being the character in someone else's story to becoming the narrator of your own.  
* *Dominant narratives* — cultural, familial, institutional stories that constrain identity — are the Given that people often don't recognize as Given. They feel like "just how things are."  
* *Preferred identity* — who the person wants to become — connects to BECOMING. Narrative Therapy asks: what story supports who you're becoming?

Both frameworks treat stories as constructed, not fixed. Both honor the power of narrative without being trapped by it. Both aim for agency.

**Where they differ:**

1. *Story as primary.* Narrative Therapy is built entirely on the premise that we live in and through stories—identity is narrative. Threads treats MEMORY as one thread among seven. Story is crucial but not totalizing. Sometimes the issue isn't narrative; it's timing (PAUSE) or embodiment (EMBODIMENT) or uncertainty (UNCERTAINTY).

2. *Political consciousness.* Narrative Therapy emerged from a postmodern, social justice orientation. White and Epston were explicit that dominant narratives serve power—patriarchy, colonialism, heteronormativity shape the stories available to people. Threads is less politically explicit, though the framework can certainly be applied to systemic oppression.

3. *Externalization as technique.* Narrative Therapy has a specific method—externalizing conversations—that create linguistic separation between person and problem. "When did Anxiety first show up? What does Anxiety want you to believe?" Threads doesn't have this technique; it names the tension but doesn't provide the externalization methodology.

4. *The role of the Given.* Narrative Therapy can sometimes lean toward the Chosen pole—emphasizing re-authoring, preferred stories, escaping dominant narratives. Threads insists on honoring both poles. The Given isn't just prison; it's also inheritance, roots, the wisdom of what came before. Cutting off from the Given is its own collapse.

5. *Audience and witness.* Narrative Therapy emphasizes re-membering practices—reconnecting with supportive figures from past and present who witness the preferred identity. Outsider witness groups, definitional ceremonies. This communal witnessing isn't explicit in Threads, though PRESENCE (Between) gestures toward it.

**The integration:**

* Use Narrative Therapy's externalization when MEMORY is the activated thread and the client is Told (possessed by a problem-saturated story)  
* Use Threads to ensure re-authoring doesn't collapse into the Chosen pole—honor what the Given story protected, what wisdom it carried  
* When unique outcomes emerge, name them as evidence of capacity to hold both poles  
* Use Threads to identify when the presenting "story problem" is actually a different thread—sometimes what looks like narrative stuckness is really PAUSE or CONSENT

**The honest positioning:**

"Narrative Therapy is a powerful approach for helping people reclaim authorship of their lives. Its techniques—externalization, unique outcomes, re-authoring—are specific and effective. Threads doesn't replace these methods. What Threads adds is the insistence on honoring both poles: the Given (what happened, what was inherited) and the Chosen (what meaning we make, what story we tell now). Narrative Therapy can sometimes lean toward re-authoring as escape. Threads asks: what wisdom lived in the old story? What do we carry forward even as we write something new? Use Narrative Therapy for the methodology. Use Threads to ensure the re-authoring integrates rather than erases."

**Mindfulness-Based Approaches (MBSR, MBCT)**

**Mindfulness-Based Approaches ask:** "How do we cultivate present-moment, non-judgmental awareness so that we can relate differently to pain, stress, and difficult mental states?"

**Threads asks:** "What universal tensions are people stuck in, and how do we hold them so something new can emerge?"

**Where they overlap:**

Mindfulness is the foundation of capacity to hold tension at all. Without present-moment awareness, there is no "holding"—only reactivity.

* *Present-moment awareness* is PRESENCE work—specifically the Here pole. Mindfulness trains attention to return to now, again and again.  
* *Non-judgmental observation* is the stance required to hold any tension. The moment we judge one pole as bad, we collapse away from it.  
* *Noticing without reacting* is exactly the pause between stimulus and response that PAUSE requires. Mindfulness builds the gap where choice lives.  
* *Observing thoughts as thoughts* (not facts) is MEMORY work—recognizing the Told as a story rather than reality, creating space for authorship.  
* *Sitting with discomfort* is the foundational skill of tension-holding. Mindfulness trains people to stay present to what's uncomfortable without fleeing or fixing.  
* *Body awareness* in MBSR is EMBODIMENT—cultivating the Think/Feel connection, noticing what the body knows.

**Where they differ:**

1. *Awareness vs. navigation.* Mindfulness cultivates a quality of awareness. Threads provides a map of what you're aware *of*. Mindfulness says: "Notice what's arising." Threads says: "What's arising is one of seven universal tensions, and here's how to work with it."

2. *Individual practice vs. relational application.* MBSR and MBCT are primarily individual—you sit, you notice, you cultivate equanimity. Threads extends into dyads, groups, organizations. Mindfulness builds individual capacity; Threads applies that capacity relationally.

3. *Acceptance orientation.* Mindfulness-based approaches emphasize acceptance—being with what is, not trying to change it. Threads aims for emergence—something new arising from held tension. Acceptance may be necessary for emergence, but emergence is a more active claim. Mindfulness might be content with equanimity; Threads expects transformation.

4. *Therapeutic specificity.* MBCT (Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy) has specific protocols for depression relapse prevention—it targets ruminative thought patterns that predict relapse. This is clinically precise in a way Threads is not.

5. *Spiritual roots vs. philosophical roots.* Mindfulness comes from Buddhist contemplative practice, secularized for clinical application. Threads comes from process philosophy. Different lineages, compatible in practice.

6. *The risk of spiritual bypassing.* Mindfulness can be misused to avoid rather than hold—"I'll just observe my anger" can become a way to not feel it. This is EMBODIMENT collapse into Think disguised as spiritual practice. Threads names this trap; mindfulness practice alone may not.

**The integration:**

* Mindfulness is *prerequisite* for Threads work. Without the capacity to notice what's arising without reactivity, you can't hold tension.  
* Use mindfulness to build the foundational awareness muscle  
* Use Threads to name what you're becoming aware of—which tension, which poles, where collapse is happening  
* MBSR's body scan is EMBODIMENT training; use it to build capacity for that thread  
* When mindfulness practice goes flat or becomes avoidant, Threads can diagnose: which tension are you using mindfulness to escape?

**The honest positioning:**

"Mindfulness is foundational. The capacity to notice what's arising without reactivity is the prerequisite for holding any tension. Threads doesn't replace mindfulness practice—Threads depends on it. What Threads adds is a map. Mindfulness says 'be present to what is.' Threads says 'what is includes these seven tensions, and here's how to navigate them.' Use mindfulness to build the awareness capacity. Use Threads to direct that awareness toward the tensions that shape your life—and to extend the practice into relational contexts where individual equanimity isn't enough."

**Motivational Interviewing (MI)**

**MI asks:** "How do we help people explore and resolve ambivalence so they can move toward change they already value but feel stuck about?"

**Threads asks:** "What universal tensions are people stuck in, and how do we hold them so something new can emerge?"

**Where they overlap:**

MI's core insight is that ambivalence is normal, not pathological. People want to change AND don't want to change. Sound familiar?

* *Ambivalence as expected* — MI treats ambivalence as the natural state before change, not resistance to overcome. This is Threads territory: the tension between Same and Different (BECOMING), between Not Yet and Now (PAUSE), between what is and what could be.  
* *Rolling with resistance* — When someone pushes back, MI doesn't push harder. It honors the resistance as carrying information. This is honoring the wisdom in the pole the person is protecting.  
* *Developing discrepancy* — MI helps people see the gap between where they are and where they want to be. This surfaces the tension rather than resolving it prematurely.  
* *Supporting self-efficacy* — MI trusts the person's own wisdom about their life. The practitioner doesn't impose solutions. This parallels Threads' stance that emergence comes from the person, not the facilitator.  
* *Change talk and sustain talk* — MI listens for language that moves toward change versus language that maintains the status quo. These are expressions of the poles in BECOMING and PAUSE.  
* *The decisional balance* — Exploring pros and cons of change and staying the same is explicit pole-mapping.

**Where they differ:**

1. *Direction toward change.* MI has a direction—it's designed to help people move toward change they've identified as valuable. The practitioner evokes change talk, not sustain talk. Threads is non-directional about which pole is "right." Sometimes the wisdom is in staying, not changing.

2. *Specific behavior focus.* MI typically addresses specific behaviors—substance use, medication adherence, health behaviors. The ambivalence is about something concrete. Threads addresses existential tensions that may not have a specific behavioral target.

3. *The righting reflex.* MI explicitly warns against the "righting reflex"—the practitioner's urge to fix, advise, solve. Threads shares this but frames it as the facilitator's own collapse toward resolution.

4. *Spirit vs. technique.* MI distinguishes the "spirit" of MI (partnership, acceptance, compassion, evocation) from the techniques (OARS: open questions, affirmations, reflections, summaries). The spirit IS the tension-holding stance. The techniques are specific moves.

5. *Readiness as stage.* MI often uses stages of change (precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance). This is linear and developmental. Threads sees the tension as ongoing—you don't graduate from BECOMING; you keep navigating it.

**The integration:**

* MI's spirit IS the Threads facilitative stance—curious, non-anxious, trusting the person's wisdom  
* Use MI techniques (OARS) when working with ambivalence about change  
* Use Threads to name which thread the ambivalence is about—often BECOMING, PAUSE, or CONSENT  
* When MI feels stuck, check: is the practitioner pushing toward change (violating MI spirit) or has the client collapsed into one pole?  
* MI's focus on specific behavior change can be the concrete application of Threads' broader tension navigation

**The honest positioning:**

"Motivational Interviewing is a well-researched, widely-used approach for helping people resolve ambivalence about change. Its spirit—partnership, acceptance, compassion, evocation—mirrors the Threads facilitative stance exactly. What Threads adds is a map of what the ambivalence is *about*. MI asks: 'Are you ready to change this behavior?' Threads asks: 'What universal tension is this ambivalence expressing?' Use MI for behavioral change contexts where the direction is clear. Use Threads when the ambivalence is existential—when it's not about a behavior but about who you're becoming, what boundaries to hold, what timing is right."

**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**

**CBT asks:** "How do we identify and modify the distorted thoughts and maladaptive behaviors that cause emotional suffering?"

**Threads asks:** "What universal tensions are people stuck in, and how do we hold them so something new can emerge?"

**Where they overlap:**

This is the least natural fit—but given CBT's dominance, you need to address it.

* *Cognitive distortions* often represent collapse. All-or-nothing thinking is the failure to hold both poles. Catastrophizing is UNCERTAINTY collapse into Threat. "Should" statements can be MEMORY collapse into Told—inherited rules operating as absolute truth.  
* *Behavioral activation* addresses PAUSE—moving from Not Yet into Now when depression has frozen someone in inaction.  
* *Exposure therapy* is building capacity to hold UNCERTAINTY (approaching what's feared) and EMBODIMENT (staying present to discomfort without fleeing).  
* *Thought records* create observer distance from automatic thoughts—similar to moving from Told to Telling in MEMORY.  
* *Behavioral experiments* test beliefs against reality—moving from Hide to Seek in UNCERTAINTY.

**Where they differ:**

1. *Pathology model.* CBT identifies thoughts as "distorted" and aims to correct them. Threads doesn't pathologize either pole—both carry wisdom. What CBT calls distortion, Threads might call collapse that once served a protective function.

2. *Correction vs. holding.* CBT aims to change the thought or behavior. Threads aims to hold the tension. CBT says: "That thought is distorted; here's a more balanced thought." Threads says: "That thought represents one pole; what's the wisdom in the other pole you've lost access to?"

3. *Linear causation.* CBT's model: thoughts cause feelings cause behaviors. Change the thought, change the feeling. Threads sees circular, emergent causation—the tension itself is generative, not a problem to be corrected.

4. *Manualized protocols.* CBT has highly structured, manualized treatments for specific disorders—CBT for depression, CBT for anxiety, CBT for OCD. This specificity produces strong research outcomes. Threads is a general framework, not a disorder-specific protocol.

5. *The body's role.* Traditional CBT is cognitive-first. Even when behavior is targeted, the theory privileges thought. Threads (through EMBODIMENT) insists the body isn't downstream of cognition—it has its own knowing. Third-wave CBT approaches (ACT, DBT) have corrected this, but classical CBT remains head-centric.

6. *Symptom reduction vs. emergence.* CBT's goal is symptom reduction—less depression, less anxiety, fewer panic attacks. Threads' goal is emergence—something genuinely new arising. Symptom reduction might be a byproduct, but it's not the aim.

**The tension in the comparison:**

Here's the honest difficulty: CBT's model and Threads' model may be philosophically incompatible at a deep level. CBT assumes some thoughts are wrong and should be fixed. Threads assumes both poles carry truth and should be held. These are different orientations toward human suffering.

That said, many clinicians use CBT pragmatically without being committed to its philosophical assumptions. For them, Threads can inform *which* thoughts to examine and *why* those particular distortions developed.

**The integration:**

* Use Threads to understand why a cognitive distortion exists—what pole is the person protecting? What wound made that collapse adaptive?  
* Use CBT techniques to build skills when collapse is severe and destabilizing (behavioral activation for immobilizing depression, exposure for paralyzing anxiety)  
* Recognize that what CBT calls "balanced thinking" is often what Threads calls "holding both poles"  
* Use Threads to identify when CBT might be pushing toward one pole rather than facilitating genuine both/and  
* Third-wave CBT approaches (ACT, DBT) are more Threads-compatible than classical CBT

**The honest positioning:**

"CBT is the most widely practiced and researched therapeutic approach. Its techniques—thought records, behavioral activation, exposure—are effective tools for specific symptoms. Threads has a different philosophical foundation: where CBT sees distorted thoughts to correct, Threads sees collapsed tensions to hold. These aren't fully compatible worldviews. However, many CBT techniques can be used within a Threads frame. What Threads adds is the question CBT doesn't ask: what wisdom lived in the 'distorted' thought? What was it protecting? Use CBT techniques for skill-building when collapse is severe. Use Threads to understand the architecture of what's being corrected—and to ensure that 'balanced thinking' genuinely honors both poles rather than privileging one."

**Focusing (Gendlin)**

**Focusing asks:** "How do we access the felt sense—the body's murky, pre-verbal knowing—and allow it to unfold into meaning and movement?"

**Threads asks:** "What universal tensions are people stuck in, and how do we hold them so something new can emerge?"

**Where they overlap:**

Focusing is the most direct precedent for what Threads claims about EMBODIMENT and emergence.

* *Felt sense* — Gendlin's core concept is the body's knowing that exists before words. It's not emotion exactly, not thought exactly—it's the whole sense of a situation held in the body. This IS the EMBODIMENT thread: the body knows things the mind hasn't articulated.  
* *The body shift* — Focusing aims for a physical release that comes when the felt sense is accurately symbolized. Something unlocks. This is emergence at the somatic level—something new arising from attending to what's held.  
* *Waiting, not forcing* — Focusing requires patience. You don't grab at the felt sense; you keep it company. You wait for it to reveal itself. This is PAUSE—staying in Not Yet until the moment is right.  
* *"Something about..."* — Focusing uses tentative, approaching language. "Something about this situation feels..." This tentativeness honors not-knowing—UNCERTAINTY held without collapsing into premature clarity.  
* *The critic's chair* — Gendlin recognized that inner critics block felt-sense access. You have to ask the critic to step back. This is navigating CONSENT—internal parts negotiating boundaries so the deeper knowing can speak.

**Where they differ:**

1. *Single-thread depth vs. seven-thread breadth.* Focusing goes deep into EMBODIMENT. It's a complete methodology for accessing body-knowing. Threads maps seven tensions; EMBODIMENT is one. Focusing is the specialist; Threads is the generalist.

2. *Process vs. map.* Focusing is a process—six movements (clearing a space, felt sense, handle, resonating, asking, receiving). It's a how-to. Threads is a diagnostic map. Threads tells you EMBODIMENT is activated; Focusing tells you what to do about it.

3. *Individual practice.* Focusing is primarily a solo or dyadic practice—you do it alone or with a companion who listens. Threads scales to groups and organizations. Focusing doesn't have an organizational application the way Threads does.

4. *Philosophical grounding.* Gendlin was a philosopher first—his work on "experiencing" and "carrying forward" anticipates process thinking. He and Whitehead would have had a lot to discuss. The philosophical compatibility is high, though they developed independently.

5. *The implicit.* Gendlin's later work emphasized "the implicit"—the more-than-what's-formed that every situation carries. This is close to what Threads calls emergence. The implicit is what wants to come into being; emergence is its arrival.

**The integration:**

* When EMBODIMENT is the activated thread, Focusing provides the methodology  
* Use Focusing's felt sense inquiry when someone is collapsed into Think—living in their head, disconnected from body-knowing  
* Use Focusing's patient, waiting stance as the model for all thread-holding—PAUSE applied to somatic inquiry  
* The "body shift" is evidence of emergence—track it as a sign that something new has arrived  
* Focusing-Oriented Therapy (FOT) is a full clinical application; Threads can inform when to apply it

**The deeper connection:**

Gendlin's work may be the closest philosophical cousin to what you're building. His insight that the body carries forward implicit meaning that can unfold into the new—that's emergence theory grounded in somatic experience. If you haven't read *Focusing* or *A Process Model*, they might be worth revisiting. You may find ancestors.

**The honest positioning:**

"Focusing is a profound practice for accessing the body's knowing—what Gendlin called the felt sense. It provides a detailed methodology for the EMBODIMENT thread that Threads only names. When someone is stuck in their head, disconnected from body-wisdom, Focusing is the intervention. Threads tells you when EMBODIMENT is activated. Focusing tells you how to work with it. Gendlin's philosophical work on 'carrying forward' and 'the implicit' is deeply compatible with Threads' emergence claims. Use Focusing when the body needs to speak. Use Threads to understand which of seven tensions the body is speaking about."
