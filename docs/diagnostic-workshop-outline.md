# Organizational Thread Diagnostic Workshop
**3-Hour Leadership Team Session**

---

## Workshop Overview

**Purpose:** Identify which threads are driving organizational tension and develop initial navigation strategies

**Audience:** Leadership teams (5-15 participants)
- C-suite executives
- Department heads
- Team leads navigating specific tensions

**Format:** Facilitated in-person or virtual session

---

## Pre-Workshop Preparation

### 2 Weeks Before:
- Leadership team completes Organizational Thread Assessment individually
- Facilitator reviews results to identify likely primary threads
- Participants submit 1-2 current tensions they want to address

### 1 Week Before:
- Facilitator shares agenda and pre-reading:
  - Introduction to Seven Threads (10-minute read)
  - Assessment results summary (anonymized)
- Optional: 15-minute 1:1 calls with key stakeholders

---

## Workshop Agenda

### **Part 1: Foundations (45 minutes)**

#### 0:00-0:10 | Welcome & Framing
- Introductions (if needed)
- Workshop goals and structure
- Ground rules:
  - Curiosity over judgment
  - Name patterns, not blame people
  - Tensions are data, not problems to solve

#### 0:10-0:30 | Seven Threads Framework
**Interactive teaching segment**

- Brief overview of all seven threads
- Key concept: Tensions ≠ Problems
  - Problems have solutions
  - Tensions require navigation
- Introduce collapse patterns:
  - Oscillating (swinging between poles)
  - Stuck (collapsed into one pole)
  - Fragmented (different teams at different poles)

#### 0:30-0:45 | Assessment Results Review
- Share aggregated assessment results
- Identify threads with highest scores
- Participants share: "Which thread description resonated most?"

**Output:** Prioritized list of 2-3 threads to explore

---

### **Part 2: Thread Mapping (90 minutes)**

#### 0:45-1:15 | Primary Thread Deep Dive
**Facilitated mapping exercise**

**Step 1: Name the Tension (10 min)**
- What is the specific tension your organization is navigating?
- Frame as "X ↔ Y" (both/and, not either/or)
- Example: "Predictability ↔ Adaptability" (likely PAUSE thread)

**Step 2: Map the Poles (10 min)**
- What does full collapse into Pole A look like?
- What does full collapse into Pole B look like?
- What are the gifts of each pole? (Reframe from "good vs. bad")

**Step 3: Identify Current Collapse Pattern (10 min)**
- Are we oscillating? (Swinging back and forth)
- Are we stuck? (Collapsed into one pole, losing access to the other)
- Are we fragmented? (Different parts of the organization at different poles)

**Output:** Visual thread map on whiteboard/Miro

#### 1:15-1:30 | Break

#### 1:30-2:15 | Pattern Analysis
**Explore the system beneath the symptoms**

**Guiding Questions:**
1. **When did this tension first emerge?**
   - What organizational change triggered it?
   - Has it always been there, or is it new?

2. **Who is advocating for each pole?**
   - Which teams/roles pull toward Pole A?
   - Which teams/roles pull toward Pole B?
   - Is leadership aligned or split?

3. **What reinforces the collapse?**
   - Organizational structures (reporting, incentives, metrics)
   - Cultural norms ("how we do things here")
   - Leadership behaviors (what gets rewarded/punished)

4. **What would "holding both poles" look like?**
   - Can we imagine a scenario where both poles are honored?
   - What practices would support that?

**Output:** Root cause analysis & systemic reinforcers identified

---

### **Part 3: Navigation Strategies (45 minutes)**

#### 2:15-2:45 | Design Initial Interventions
**Brainstorm concrete next steps**

**Framework: 3 Levels of Intervention**

1. **Language:** How do we name this tension going forward?
   - Agree on thread language (e.g., "We're in a PAUSE collapse")
   - Create shorthand for teams ("Are we oscillating again?")

2. **Structure:** What organizational changes support holding both poles?
   - Decision rights clarification
   - Meeting rhythms
   - Metrics/dashboards
   - Resource allocation

3. **Practice:** What daily/weekly practices reinforce navigation?
   - Check-ins that name the thread
   - "Both/and" prompts in planning
   - Retrospectives that track collapse patterns

**Activity:** Small groups design 1-2 interventions per level

#### 2:45-3:00 | Commit to Next Steps
**Define immediate actions**

- **30-day experiment:** What will we try for the next month?
- **Who owns it:** Assign clear accountability
- **How we'll know:** Define success criteria
- **When we'll review:** Schedule follow-up check-in

**Output:** Action plan with owners and timelines

### Within 5 Business Days:
**Custom Diagnostic Report including:**
- Thread map (visual diagram)
- Collapse pattern analysis
- Recommended navigation strategies
- 30/60/90-day roadmap
- Resources for leadership team

### Within 2 Weeks:
**Follow-up call with leadership sponsor (30 min)**
- Review report
- Clarify questions
- Discuss integration options (if desired)

---

## Facilitation Approach

### Facilitator Role:
- **Pattern recognition:** Help teams see what they're too close to see
- **Non-directive:** Guide discovery, don't prescribe solutions
- **Thread fluency:** Translate organizational dynamics into thread language
- **Conflict-comfortable:** Hold space for disagreement without rushing to resolution

### Key Facilitation Moves:
1. **Name the collapse in real-time**
   - "Notice we just oscillated between planning and executing—that's the PAUSE thread showing up right now"

2. **Reframe from blame to pattern**
   - Not "Engineering is always blocking us"
   - Instead: "Engineering is holding the 'Not Yet' pole; Product is holding the 'Now' pole—how do we honor both?"

3. **Invite embodied noticing**
   - "Where do you feel this tension in your body when it shows up?"
   - "What does your gut tell you when we collapse into urgency?"

4. **Hold paradox**
   - Resist the urge to resolve too quickly
   - Let the team sit in the discomfort of "both are true"

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can we do this remotely?**
Yes. Virtual workshops use Miro or Zoom whiteboards for collaborative mapping. Effectiveness is comparable to in-person when facilitated well.

**Q: What if we're not sure which thread is primary?**
That's what the workshop is designed to discover. Pre-assessment results guide us, but the live mapping often reveals unexpected patterns.

**Q: Do we need the whole leadership team?**
Ideally yes—decision-makers who can commit to navigation strategies. Minimum 5 people; maximum 15 for effective facilitation.

**Q: What happens after the workshop?**
You have three options:
1. Take the insights and run with them (self-guided)
2. Schedule follow-up sessions for ongoing navigation support
3. Engage in full integration program (6-month partnership)

**Q: How do we measure ROI?**
Most organizations track:
- Decision-making velocity (time from issue to resolution)
- Meeting efficiency (time spent on recurring conflicts)
- Employee sentiment (engagement scores related to clarity/alignment)
- Leadership alignment (reduced escalations, faster strategic agreement)
