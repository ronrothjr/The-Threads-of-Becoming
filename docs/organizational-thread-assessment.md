# Organizational Thread Assessment Tool

**A diagnostic guide to identify which threads are driving tension in your organization**

---

## How to Use This Assessment

This tool helps leadership teams quickly identify which of the seven threads are currently in collapse or creating tension in your organization.

**Instructions:**
1. Answer each question honestly based on current organizational dynamics
2. Score each answer: **Never (0)** | **Rarely (1)** | **Sometimes (2)** | **Often (3)** | **Constantly (4)**
3. Tally your scores for each thread
4. Focus on threads scoring **8 or higher** — these are likely in collapse

## Thread 1: PRESENCE (Within ↔ Between)
*Where is organizational attention located?*

**Question 1:** Do teams struggle to balance individual deep work with collaborative team activities?
- Are people either hyper-focused on their own tasks OR constantly in meetings with no middle ground?

## Interpreting Your Results

### High Scores (8-12): Thread in Collapse
This thread is currently driving significant organizational tension. Prioritize navigating this thread.

### Medium Scores (4-7): Thread Under Tension
Watch this thread — it's not in full collapse but showing signs of strain.

### Low Scores (0-3): Thread in Balance
This thread is currently well-navigated (or not yet activated as a tension point).

---

## Next Steps

### If you scored 8+ on ANY thread:

1. **Name it:** Share this assessment with your leadership team. Use thread language to describe what's happening.

2. **Map the collapse pattern:** Are you oscillating between extremes? Stuck at one pole? Use the diagnostic workshop to map the specific pattern.

3. **Design navigation:** Don't try to "solve" the tension. Design practices that hold both poles simultaneously.

### If you scored 8+ on MULTIPLE threads:

You likely have a **systemic collapse pattern**. One thread may be primary, with others as secondary effects.

**Recommended:** Schedule a diagnostic workshop to identify the core thread driving the system.
