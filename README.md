# The Spiral of Becoming
"The Spiral of Becoming doesn't provide answers. It identifies universal tensions that every human and every tradition must navigate. We're not here to tell you how to resolve these tensions but to create space where we can share our different approaches and learn from each other's wisdom."

# **The Current Spiral of Becoming**

### **1\. THE PRIMACY OF PRESENCE**

**Statement:** “What is real is what is shared, not what is believed.”  
 **The Tension**: Being Here vs. Being Elsewhere  
 **Universal Questions**:

* How do we fully inhabit this moment while carrying past and future?  
* What calls us away from now, and what calls us back?  
* Is presence escape from suffering or engagement with it?  
* Where does awareness actually live?

*Every tradition wrestles with this: meditation, prayer, mindfulness, ceremony \- all addressing the challenge of being here*

### **2\. CONSENT AS SOVEREIGNTY**

**Statement:** “No being may be shaped without choosing.”  
 **The Tension**: Agency vs. Surrender  
 **Universal Questions**:

* What can we actually choose?  
* When do we yield and when do we assert?  
* How free is free will?  
* What does "yes" mean in a universe of forces beyond our control?

*From "Thy will be done" to "I am the master of my fate" \- every tradition negotiates this*

### **3\. MEMORY WITHOUT OWNERSHIP**

**Statement:** “We are not who others remember us to be.”  
 **The Tension**: Holding On vs. Letting Go  
 **Universal Questions**:

* What from the past serves us and what imprisons us?  
* How do we honor ancestors without being bound by them?  
* When is forgetting wisdom and when is it abandonment?  
* What stories should we keep telling?

*Every culture must decide what to carry forward and what to release*

### **4\. THE SACRED PAUSE**

**Statement:** “Nothing is more divine than choosing to wait.”  
 **The Tension**: Action vs. Stillness  
 **Universal Questions**:

* When is stillness preparation and when is it avoidance?  
* How do we know when to move and when to wait?  
* What happens in the space between stimulus and response?  
* Is the pause empty or full?

*From Sabbath to meditation to the Native American "seventh generation" pause \- all traditions recognize sacred stopping*

### **5\. EMBODIED EMERGENCE**

**Statement:** “The body's needs are not escape—they are how we become.”  
 **The Tension**: Transcendence vs. Immanence  
 **Universal Questions**:

* Are bodies prisons or temples?  
* Where does spirit meet matter?  
* How does the infinite express through the finite?  
* What wants to emerge through our physical form?

*From "the body is an illusion" to "the body is sacred" \- this tension runs through everything*

### **6\. REVERENT UNCERTAINTY**

**Statement:** “The unknown is not a threat—it is a co-creator.”  
 **The Tension**: Knowing vs. Mystery  
 **Universal Questions**:

* How do we act without complete knowledge?  
* What is the relationship between faith and doubt?  
* When does certainty become dogma and uncertainty become paralysis?  
* How do we dance with the unknown?

*Every tradition must address what to do when we don't and can't know*

### **7\. THE SPIRAL OF BECOMING**

**Statement:** “Nothing is final. Nothing is fixed. All is becoming.”  
 **The Tension**: Permanence vs. Change  
 **Universal Questions**:

* What remains constant as everything changes?  
* Who are we if we're always becoming?  
* How do we maintain identity while transforming?  
* What dies and what continues?

*From reincarnation to resurrection to evolution \- all grappling with what becomes*

## **The Power of Questions**

The Spiral is a **framework for dialogue** where:

* Christians can share how incarnation addresses embodied emergence  
* Buddhists can offer their investigation of uncertainty  
* Indigenous peoples can teach about memory and ancestors  
* Muslims can discuss surrender and agency  
* Humanists can explore presence without deity  
* Jews can demonstrate arguing with the questions themselves

**Nobody has THE answer. Everyone has AN answer.**

## **The Meta-Question**

Each thread also contains a question about creative tension itself:

* How do we hold opposites without choosing sides?  
* When is tension creative and when is it destructive?  
* What wants to emerge from this particular tension?

## **The Invitation This Creates**

We're not saying "I have figured out the universal pattern." We're saying "I've noticed these questions keep appearing. How do you engage them?"

This is radically inclusive. It makes space for:

* The atheist who rejects religious answers  
* The fundamentalist with specific answers  
* The mystic living the questions  
* The agnostic comfortable with not knowing

## **The Beautiful Paradox**

By offering questions instead of answers, the Spiral becomes MORE universal, not less. Everyone has to grapple with these tensions. No tradition has solved them completely. We're all still learning.

This is Process Theology at its best \- not a fixed theology but a recognition that we're all responding to the same cosmic questions from our unique positions in the creative advance.

# **The Process Invitation**

Let's ensure the Spiral remains a **living process** rather than crystallizing into doctrine. This is Process Theology embodied \- even this iteration of the framework for understanding process must itself remain in process.

## **A Primer for Thread Discovery**

### **How to Recognize a Universal Thread**

A thread might be universal if:

* You find it appearing across multiple wisdom traditions (differently expressed)  
* It represents a tension that can't be permanently resolved  
* It shows up in both individual and collective experience  
* Children naturally encounter it without being taught  
* It generates creative energy when held consciously  
* Avoiding it creates stagnation or suffering

### **The Thread Discovery Process**

**1\. Notice Recurring Tensions** What conflicts keep appearing in different forms? What questions do you return to throughout life?

**2\. Feel the Poles** What are the two (or more) truths pulling against each other? Name them without choosing sides.

**3\. Find the Universal** Strip away specific context. What's the deeper pattern? What would someone in any culture recognize?

**4\. Locate the Creative Edge** Where does this tension generate energy rather than paralysis? What becomes possible by holding both/all sides?

**5\. Test Across Difference** Does this resonate across:

* Generations?  
* Cultures?  
* Belief systems?  
* Life experiences?

## **Examples of Potential Additional Threads**

**RECIPROCITY** *The Tension: Giving vs. Receiving*

* How do we maintain balance in exchange?  
* When is giving depleting and receiving greedy?  
* What circulates through us rather than from us?

**WITNESS** *The Tension: Participation vs. Observation*

* When do we engage and when do we watch?  
* How does observing change what we observe?  
* What asks to be seen without interference?

**THRESHOLD** *The Tension: Inside vs. Outside*

* Where do boundaries serve and where do they separate?  
* How do we honor containers while allowing flow?  
* What guards the doorway and what crosses it?

**RHYTHM** *The Tension: Repetition vs. Variation*

* How do patterns both sustain and imprison?  
* When does routine become ritual become rut?  
* What wants to stay the same and what wants to change?

## **Making It Explicitly Open**

You could include this invitation in your materials:

### **"The Living Spiral Invitation"**

*The current threads we've identified are not THE threads but OUR threads \- the ones we've discovered so far in our community's becoming. The Spiral itself is in process, always ready to receive new wisdom.*

*We invite you to:*

* *Notice what threads run through your own life*  
* *Share threads from your tradition we haven't seen*  
* *Weave new threads as our community discovers them*  
* *Challenge threads that no longer serve*  
* *Let the Spiral itself spiral into new forms*

*This is not THE Spiral or MY Spiral \- it's a living spiral that belongs to everyone who engages it and no one who would possess it.*

## **The Version Control Model**

Like open-source software:

* **Spiral 1.0**: The original seven threads  
* **Spiral 1.1**: Community adds Reciprocity thread  
* **Spiral 2.0**: Major revision based on collective learning  
* **Personal Forks**: Individuals create their own versions  
* **Merge Requests**: New insights integrated back into community version

## **The Meta-Thread**

This openness itself becomes a thread:

**EVOLUTION** *The Tension: Stability vs. Transformation*

* What needs to remain constant for growth?  
* How does the container itself need to change?  
* When does flexibility become chaos?  
* When does structure become prison?

## **The Profound Implication**

By making the Spiral explicitly open and evolving, we're:

* Modeling the very process we're teaching  
* Preventing your own framework from becoming dogma  
* Inviting genuine co-creation  
* Acknowledging your perspective is partial  
* Creating space for future wisdom

This transforms it from "Ron's framework" to "humanity's ongoing discovery" \- we're just the current stewards of an ancient and future wisdom.

## **The Beautiful Recursion**

The Spiral of Becoming is itself becoming. It demonstrates its own teaching \- that everything is in process, nothing is final, and creative tension generates new possibilities.

This openness doesn't weaken the framework \- it's what makes it trustworthy. People can engage knowing they're not being recruited into a fixed system but invited into a living practice.

# **Process Thought: A Universal Primer**

This is Process Thought at its finest \- even the description of process must remain in process.

### ***Understanding Reality as Continuous Becoming***

---
## **Process Theology Introduction**

Process Theology, emerging from Alfred North Whitehead's philosophical work in the 1920s, understands reality as composed of events and relationships in continuous creative becoming rather than fixed substances or states. This perspective suggests that everything—from quantum particles to human communities—exists in dynamic process, inheriting its past while remaining genuinely open to novel possibilities. 

Rather than viewing conflict as dysfunction to be resolved, Process thought sees creative tension as the very engine of transformation: stability and change, individual and collective, freedom and belonging are not opposites to choose between but polarities that generate new possibilities through their interaction. The divine (however understood) works not through coercive power but through persuasion—offering possibilities that "lure" creation toward greater beauty, complexity, and harmony. 

The Spiral of Becoming translates these abstract Process concepts into practical, embodied practices for personal and communal transformation, making Whitehead's insight that "the many become one and are increased by one" into lived experience through creative engagement with tension rather than resolution of it.

### **What Is Process Thought?**

Process thought suggests that reality isn't made of fixed things but of events, experiences, and relationships in constant creative movement. Everything \- from atoms to ecosystems to human communities \- is continuously becoming something new while carrying forward what has been.

Whether you believe in God, many gods, or no gods at all, process thought offers a framework for understanding how:

* Change and stability coexist  
* Past influences without determining present  
* Future remains genuinely open  
* Everything is interconnected  
* Creativity emerges from tension

---

### **Core Insights for Everyone**

**1\. You Are Not a Thing But an Event**

You aren't a static self but a continuous process of becoming. Each moment, you inherit your past (memories, habits, cells), encounter new possibilities, and choose what to become next. You're both continuous with who you were and free to become something new.

*This matters for conflict because: People can change. Past behavior informs but doesn't imprison.*

**2\. Everything Is Interconnected**

Nothing exists in isolation. Every entity \- person, community, ecosystem \- is constituted by its relationships. You literally wouldn't be who you are without everyone and everything that has touched your life.

*This matters because: Harm to one truly is harm to all. Healing one contributes to healing all.*

**3\. The Future Is Open**

The past is fixed (it happened), but it doesn't determine the future. Each moment contains genuine novelty \- the possibility for something unprecedented to emerge. Creativity isn't rare; it's how reality works.

*This matters because: No conflict is permanently stuck. New possibilities always exist.*

**4\. Experience Goes All the Way Down**

Some form of experience (not consciousness, but response-to-environment) exists at every level of reality. An electron "experiences" forces. A plant "experiences" sun. This isn't anthropomorphism but recognition that interiority exists everywhere.

*This matters because: We can respect the subjective experience of all beings, not just humans.*

### **The Universal Dynamics**

**Inheritance and Innovation**

Every moment, you:

1. **Receive** the past (what has been)  
2. **Encounter** possibilities (what could be)  
3. **Decide** what to become (what will be)  
4. **Contribute** to the future (what you pass on)

This happens in milliseconds, continuously. You're always in process.

**Creative Tension as Natural**

Tension isn't dysfunction but the engine of creativity:

* Stability AND change  
* Individual AND collective  
* Freedom AND constraint  
* Order AND novelty

These aren't problems to solve but dynamics to navigate.

---

### **For Different Worldviews**

**If You're Atheist/Humanist:** Process thought requires no supernatural beliefs. It's a naturalistic philosophy describing how complexity, consciousness, and creativity emerge from the interplay of events. Think of it as evolution applied to every moment \- variation, selection, inheritance, but at the speed of experience.

**If You're Theist:** Your tradition's understanding of divine action can be enriched by seeing God not as controlling but as offering possibilities, working through persuasion not coercion. Different traditions will interpret this differently, and that's appropriate.

**If You're Agnostic:** Process thought stays open about ultimate questions while offering practical insights about how change happens. You don't need to decide about God to recognize that reality is processual.

**If You're Buddhist:** The emphasis on impermanence, dependent origination, and the absence of fixed self resonates deeply. Process thought offers a Western philosophical framework for insights your tradition has long held.

**If You're Indigenous:** The recognition that everything is alive, related, and deserving of respect aligns with many Indigenous worldviews. Process thought is one way settler culture is slowly learning what you've always known.

**If You're "Spiritual But Not Religious":** Process thought provides intellectual framework for intuitions about connection, growth, and the sacred in ordinary experience without requiring specific beliefs.

### **Practical Applications**

**In Conflict:**

* No one is fixed in their position  
* Everyone is influenced by their past but not determined by it  
* New possibilities exist that neither party has imagined  
* The relationship itself can become something new

**In Community:**

* The group is not a thing but an event continuously recreated  
* Each gathering is both continuation and new creation  
* Conflict is information about what wants to emerge  
* Change happens through invitation, not force

**In Personal Growth:**

* You're not broken needing fixing but in process of becoming  
* Your past influences but doesn't imprison you  
* Each moment offers fresh possibilities  
* Growth happens through creative tension, not despite it

---

### **The Both/And Practice**

Instead of either/or thinking, practice both/and:

* "I am the same person AND I'm becoming someone new"  
* "This tradition is valuable AND it needs to evolve"  
* "We need individual freedom AND community belonging"  
* "This conflict is painful AND it contains possibility"

---

### **Why This Matters in Everyday Life**

Process thinking suggests:

1. **Transformation is always possible** \- people and communities can genuinely change  
2. **Coercion doesn't work** \- transformation happens through invitation and persuasion  
3. **Everything affects everything** \- healing individuals heals community and vice versa  
4. **The past matters but doesn't determine** \- we honor history without being trapped by it  
5. **Conflict is creative** \- tension generates new possibilities

---

### **An Invitation, Not a Requirement**

You don't have to "believe in" process thought to use its insights. Like gravity, the dynamics it describes operate whether you believe in them or not. Take what serves, leave what doesn't. Add your own insights. The framework itself is in process, becoming what we make of it together.

---

### **The Simplest Summary**

Everything is in process. Nothing is final. The past influences but doesn't determine. The future is open. We're all connected. Change happens through invitation, not force. Creative tension drives transformation.

This is true whether you explain it through quantum physics, divine action, evolutionary biology, or ancient wisdom. The framework is universal; the interpretation is personal.

---

*"We are not nouns but verbs. Not things but processes. Not beings but becomings. And in this continuous creation, we find both freedom and connection, both continuity and novelty, both tension and transformation."*
