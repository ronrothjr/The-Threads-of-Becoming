# The Threads of Becoming v1.0.1
## **Expectations**
"The Threads of Becoming don't provide answers. They identify universal tensions that every human and every tradition must navigate. We're not here to tell you how to resolve these tensions but to create space where we can share our different approaches and learn from each other's wisdom."

_Let's admit what it's NOT:_

* Not a complete theology
* Not a psychological system
* Not a solution to all problems
* Not immune to misuse
* Not finished evolving

It's a **practice framework for engaging creative tension** within and between individuals and communities. _That's all. That's enough._

## **Preface**

This framework's wisdom isn't in inventing new methods but in synthesizing existing ones — creating space for holding creative tension and teaching others to do the same. The deeper wager: asking good questions is an answer for dialogue across most of what separates us as human beings.

This inverts the often limited "let's find common ground" approach. Forget common answers; find common questions. Let different answers enrich the shared inquiry rather than fracture it.

The framework's power isn't that it tells anyone what to believe about presence, consent, memory, or belonging. It's that it gives people a place to stand together while believing different things — the shared question as common ground.

## **Mission:**

The mission of The Threads of Becoming (TOB) open-source project is to function as a **living framework for engaging creative tension** that evolves through **collective wisdom and continuous practice**.

The project aims to serve as a **practice framework** that provides common ground for diverse theological and philosophical viewpoints, rather than functioning as a complete or fixed theological system.

### Core Mission Components

1.  **To Identify Universal Tensions**
2.  **To Foster Co-Creation and Dialogue** 
3.  **To Remain Dynamically Evolving**
4.  **To Provide a Practice-Based Toolset**
5.  **To Provide Common Ground Below Human Experience**
6.  **To Ensure Openness and Accessibility**

The underlying philosophy is that the framework succeeds not by being complete, but by being **generatively incomplete**. This openness transforms the project from an individual creation to **"humanity's ongoing discovery"**.

The project is continually refined by its own struggles with tensions (such as Universal $\leftrightarrow$ Particular and Simple $\leftrightarrow$ Complex), demonstrating the very process it seeks to teach: **The Threads of Becoming is itself becoming**.

As an open-source project, its ultimate success is measured not by the absence of conflict or adherence to doctrine, but by whether it creates **more possibility than it closes**.

### **Keeping It Explicitly Open**

We are dedicated to allowing this space to grow and change through community involvement, not private ownership.

## **Your Path Begins Here...**

### **[The Current Threads of Becoming](https://ronrothjr.github.io/The-Threads-of-Becoming/threads.html)**

These are the original seven threads tested in the specific context of a Unitarian Universalist community in South Florida.

### **[A Basic Navigation Framework](navigation.md)**

This basic framework for navigating the threads delivers on the promise in our tagline without overreaching, giving space for cultural and community adaptation.

## **If You Want to Contribute...**

### **[A Primer for Thread Discovery](thread-discovery.md)**

This is a first pass at providing the initial structure for sharing wisdom by identifying universal tensions.

### **[Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)**

The Threads of Becoming is a living framework, designed to evolve through practice and collective wisdom in this particular GitHub setting. We invite contributions that:

* Identify new universal tensions/threads
* Share how different traditions engage these questions
* Offer practices for embodying these tensions
* Document applications in communities

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.
