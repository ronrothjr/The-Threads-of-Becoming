How to Use These Case Studies
Each case study follows the same structure, demonstrating how the Threads framework applies across different contexts—couples, congregations, organizations, coaching, therapy, healthcare, families, community organizing, and conflict transformation.
Note: These cases are composites drawn from multiple real situations. Names and identifying details have been changed.
Section
What It Shows
Presenting Tension
How the situation appeared before applying the framework
Poles Identified
Which thread was activated and what each pole looked like
Collapse Observed
How parties collapsed toward one pole, losing access to the other
Engagement Steps
The facilitation moves used to hold creative tension
Emergence Outcome
What emerged when tension was held rather than resolved


CASE STUDY 1
"You never show up for me."
Thread: PRESENCE (Within ↔ Between)

PRESENTING TENSION
A couple (Elena & Marc) arrives in crisis. Elena says Marc is emotionally unavailable. Marc says Elena is suffocating him. Each feels the other is the problem.

POLES IDENTIFIED
WITHIN
Marc withdraws to regulate himself. Solitude feels safe; connection feels demanding.
BETWEEN
Elena reaches for connection when distressed. Aloneness feels like abandonment.

COLLAPSE OBSERVED
⚠ Marc collapses into Within → Elsewhere. He's fled connection entirely.
⚠ Elena collapses into Between → Here. She's clinging to avoid aloneness.

ENGAGEMENT STEPS
Arrive: Shared grounding. "Before we dive in, let's take a breath together."
Name the Thread: "Is this about presence—yours to each other?"
Surface Poles: Marc names his need for within. Elena names her need for between. Both are valid.
Identify Collapse: Help each see how their protective strategy has become rigid.
Hold Creative Tension: "What if both could be true? What would partial connection look like?"
Honor Unchosen Pole: Marc practices staying present while needing space. Elena practices self-soothing.
✓ EMERGENCE: They create a "90-second pause" ritual. When tension rises, Marc stays in the room but can be silent. Elena asks for one sentence of reassurance. Neither gets their full pole—but neither collapses.


CASE STUDY 2
The Worship Style Divide
Thread: MEMORY (Given ↔ Chosen)

PRESENTING TENSION
A UU congregation is polarized between "traditionalists" who want established liturgy and "innovators" who want contemporary worship. Each thinks the other is destroying the congregation.

POLES IDENTIFIED
GIVEN
Tradition, continuity. "This is who we are. Our history matters."
CHOSEN
Evolution, new expression. "We must stay relevant. Growth requires change."

COLLAPSE OBSERVED
⚠ Traditionalists → Told. Inherited forms treated as sacred.
⚠ Innovators → Telling. Tradition treated as obstacle.

ENGAGEMENT STEPS
Arrive: Begin with what everyone loves about this community.
Name the Thread: "This is about Memory—what we've inherited and what we're authoring."
Surface Poles: Name what each side protects. Both protect something real.
Identify Collapse: Help each side see how their position has become rigid.
Hold Creative Tension: "What gifts does the past offer? What is the future calling toward?"
Honor Unchosen Pole: Traditionalists explore new forms for old values. Innovators explore what tradition offers.
✓ EMERGENCE: "Woven liturgy" services pairing traditional hymns with contemporary poetry. Neither pole dominates—both inform a richer whole.


CASE STUDY 3
Two Directors, One Budget
Thread: PAUSE (Not Yet ↔ Now)

PRESENTING TENSION
Director of Product and Director of Operations in constant conflict. Product wants to "move fast." Operations wants to "get it right." Projects stall as they battle.

POLES IDENTIFIED
NOT YET
"We don't know enough yet. Rushing creates technical debt."
NOW
"We're losing ground. Perfect is the enemy of good."

COLLAPSE OBSERVED
⚠ Product: endless delay. "Not yet" becomes "never."
⚠ Operations: reactive urgency. Action without reflection.

ENGAGEMENT STEPS
Arrive: "You both want this company to succeed. Let's start there."
Name the Thread: "This is about timing. When is 'now' and when is 'not yet'?"
Surface Poles: Name what each protects. Both carry legitimate organizational wisdom.
Identify Collapse: Help each see how their position has calcified.
Hold Creative Tension: "What can be decided now? What genuinely needs more time?"
Honor Unchosen Pole: Product identifies what can move now. Operations identifies what needs gestation.
✓ EMERGENCE: Phased rollout: core features ship immediately (Now), while complex integrations get structured development time (Not Yet). Regular checkpoints prevent collapse.


CASE STUDY 4
"I don't know who I'm becoming."
Thread: BECOMING (Same ↔ Different)

PRESENTING TENSION
A senior leader is torn about stepping into a C-suite role. Pulled between comfort of current expertise and excitement about opportunity. Flip-flops weekly.

POLES IDENTIFIED
SAME
"I know who I am here. I've earned this. Why risk it?"
DIFFERENT
"What if this is who I'm meant to become? What if I'm ready?"

COLLAPSE OBSERVED
⚠ Same: "I'll never be ready." Fear masquerading as humility.
⚠ Different: Idealized fantasies ignoring real challenges.

ENGAGEMENT STEPS
Arrive: "Before we strategize, how are you actually feeling about this?"
Name the Thread: "This is about Becoming—who you are and who you're becoming."
Surface Poles: "What does 'Same' protect? What does 'Different' promise?"
Identify Collapse: Help her see how she's swinging rather than integrating.
Hold Creative Tension: "What if both are true? You ARE who you've been AND you're becoming someone new?"
Honor Unchosen Pole: Safe-to-fail identity experiments. Try on new role in low-stakes ways.
✓ EMERGENCE: 90-day transition honoring existing identity while stepping into new one. Takes role with "learning stance"—bringing expertise while openly developing new capacities.


CASE STUDY 5
A Stuck Trauma Pattern
Thread: EMBODIMENT (Think ↔ Feel)

PRESENTING TENSION
A trauma survivor oscillates between intellectualizing (clinical terms) and being overwhelmed (panic, dissociation). Can't process the trauma.

POLES IDENTIFIED
THINK
Cognitive processing. Safe but disconnected from body.
FEEL
Somatic experience. Alive but overwhelming.

COLLAPSE OBSERVED
⚠ Think: Dissociation. Describes trauma but cut off from felt experience.
⚠ Feel: Flooding. No cognitive container holds the sensation.

ENGAGEMENT STEPS
Arrive: "Can you feel your feet on the floor?"
Name the Thread: "Notice what happens with thinking and feeling. Can you be aware of both?"
Surface Poles: "What does going into your head protect? What does flooding signal?"
Identify Collapse: Help her notice the moment before collapse in either direction.
Hold Creative Tension: Dual awareness at low intensity. Think AND feel with neutral material.
Honor Unchosen Pole: Titrated exposure. Touch feeling while maintaining cognitive presence.
✓ EMERGENCE: Window of tolerance expands. She can describe experience (Think) while noticing body (Feel) without collapsing. Dual awareness becomes container for trauma processing.


CASE STUDY 6
"Do we move forward with the initiative?"
Thread: UNCERTAINTY (Hide ↔ Seek)

PRESENTING TENSION
Leadership team split about new initiative. Some excited by potential; others terrified by risks. Group is paralyzed.

POLES IDENTIFIED
HIDE
"We don't know enough. The downside is catastrophic."
SEEK
"We'll figure it out. The upside is transformative."

COLLAPSE OBSERVED
⚠ Hide → Threat: Every unknown is disaster waiting to happen.
⚠ Seek → Naivety: Risks minimized or ignored.

ENGAGEMENT STEPS
Arrive: "We're all here because we care. Let's remember that."
Name the Thread: "This is about Uncertainty—how we relate to what we can't know."
Surface Poles: "What is Hide protecting? What is Seek reaching for?"
Identify Collapse: Help team see how fear and enthusiasm have become rigid.
Hold Creative Tension: "What would honor both caution and possibility?"
Honor Unchosen Pole: What would a pilot look like? Forward movement with safeguards?
✓ EMERGENCE: Six-week pilot with clear success metrics and kill criteria. Honors both Hide (defined limits, safe exit) and Seek (forward movement, learning).


ADDITIONAL CASE STUDIES
Expanding contexts and completing thread coverage
CASE STUDY 7
The Exhausted Executive Director
Thread: CONSENT (Yes ↔ No)

PRESENTING TENSION
Marcus, founder/ED of a growing nonprofit, works 70-hour weeks, serves on three boards, can't say no. Staff is worried. Family is frustrated. He says: "I need better time management."

POLES IDENTIFIED
YES
Openness, generosity. "People are counting on me. The mission matters."
NO
Boundaries, limits. "I have finite capacity. Some things are not mine to carry."

COLLAPSE OBSERVED
⚠ Marcus collapsed into Yes. Every request feels like obligation. Saying no feels like betrayal. His identity is fused with being the one who shows up. Underneath: worth comes from what he gives; setting limits = selfish.

ENGAGEMENT STEPS
Arrive: "When was the last time you said no?" (Long silence.)
Name the Thread: "This isn't time management. It's about Consent—your capacity to say both Yes AND No."
Surface Poles: "What does Yes protect? What does No threaten?"
Identify Collapse: "You've lost access to No. What would it mean to choose your Yeses?"
Hold Creative Tension: "What if No is actually in service of the mission?"
Honor Unchosen Pole: Practice small Nos. Notice what happens. Track the stories that arise.
✓ EMERGENCE: "Consent Inventory"—every commitment rated by energy cost and mission alignment. Resigns from one board, delegates two programs. Counterintuitively, effectiveness increases. "I used to think boundaries were selfish. Now I see they sustain my real yeses."


CASE STUDY 8
The Board's Identity Crisis
Thread: BECOMING (Same ↔ Different)

PRESENTING TENSION
40-year manufacturing company's board deadlocked. Half want core industrial products ("We know who we are"). Half want pivot to sustainability tech ("The market is shifting"). Consultant brought in to "break the tie."

POLES IDENTIFIED
SAME
"We built this on industrial excellence. That's our DNA."
DIFFERENT
"Companies that don't adapt become Kodak."

COLLAPSE OBSERVED
⚠ Same: Any change = betrayal of founders. Can't distinguish values from products.
⚠ Different: Dismisses 40 years as irrelevant. Chasing trends without grounding.

ENGAGEMENT STEPS
Arrive: "I'm not here to break a tie. I'm here to help you discover what's actually trying to emerge."
Name the Thread: "This is about Becoming—organizational identity."
Surface Poles: Same faction: "What are you really protecting?" (Craftsmanship, relationships). Different faction: "What are you reaching for?" (Innovation, legacy).
Identify Collapse: Help each faction see how their position excludes valid concerns.
Hold Creative Tension: "How do we bring core strengths into a changing market?"
Honor Unchosen Pole: Same explores new markets for craftsmanship. Different explores enduring strengths.
✓ EMERGENCE: Core competency isn't "industrial products" but "precision manufacturing and partnerships." Launch sustainability division applying existing capabilities. Strategy becomes "Same AND Different." Two years later, new division = 30% of revenue.


CASE STUDY 9
The Coalition's Inside/Outside Divide
Thread: PRESENCE (Within ↔ Between)

PRESENTING TENSION
Housing justice coalition fracturing. Some want to negotiate with city ("inside game"). Others want protests ("outside game"). Meetings became shouting matches. Coalition at risk of dissolution.

POLES IDENTIFIED
WITHIN (Inside)
Work within system. Build relationships with power. "Change happens in rooms where decisions are made."
BETWEEN (Outside)
Build people power. Create pressure. "Power concedes nothing without demand."

COLLAPSE OBSERVED
⚠ Inside: Lost connection to grassroots. Negotiations professionalized, disconnected.
⚠ Outside: Protest as performance. "If you negotiate, you're a sellout."

ENGAGEMENT STEPS
Arrive: "Tell me about someone you're organizing for. What's at stake?"
Name the Thread: "You're arguing about Presence—where power lives. Historically, successful movements hold both."
Surface Poles: "What does inside strategy make possible? What does outside?"
Identify Collapse: "Inside people: when did you last mobilize? Outside people: what specific policy win?"
Hold Creative Tension: "What if negotiators are most powerful when pressure is visible?"
Honor Unchosen Pole: Inside commits to public action before negotiations. Outside commits to specific demand.
✓ EMERGENCE: Coordinated strategy: 500 people at city hall SAME DAY formal proposal presented. Council experiences pressure AND path forward. Ordinance passes. Coalition realizes tactical diversity is strength when coordinated.


CASE STUDY 10
The Right Relations Team engagement
Threads: MEMORY + CONSENT

PRESENTING TENSION
UU congregation's RRT called for conflict between music director (12-year tenure) and new choir member pushing for contemporary repertoire. Artistic disagreement became personal. Choir fracturing; members stopped coming.

POLES IDENTIFIED
MEMORY: GIVEN
Director's identity tied to program. "This is my legacy."
MEMORY: CHOSEN
New member wants evolution. "Music should grow."
CONSENT: NO
Director: suggestions feel like violations. "My domain."
CONSENT: YES
New member: feeling excluded. "Why is input not welcome?"

RRT ENGAGEMENT STEPS
Separate Conversations: RRT meets individually. Listens deeply. Validates without taking sides.
Name the Threads: "This involves Memory and Consent."
Facilitated Dialogue: Bring together. Ground rules: speak from "I," listen to understand.
Surface What's Under: Director: fear of being obsolete, grief. New member: desire to belong.
Hold Creative Tension: "What honors legacy AND welcomes fresh contributions?"
Co-Create Agreements: Together. "What boundaries feel right? What openings?"
✓ EMERGENCE: "Guest Programming"—2 services/year where members propose new music. New member becomes coordinator. Director begins succession planning. Both say conflict surfaced something that needed attention. Choir members return.


CASE STUDY 11
The Curfew Wars
Threads: CONSENT + BECOMING

PRESENTING TENSION
Family therapist sees Maya (16) and parents. Sessions become battlegrounds over curfews, phones, "respect." Parents say Maya is defiant. Maya says parents are controlling. Maya has started lying.

POLES IDENTIFIED
CONSENT: NO (Parents)
Protection. "We know dangers she can't see."
CONSENT: YES (Maya)
Autonomy. "I'll never learn if they control everything."
BECOMING: SAME
"She's still our little girl."
BECOMING: DIFFERENT
"I'm becoming my own person."

ENGAGEMENT STEPS
Arrive: "Maya, what do you most need your parents to understand?"
Name the Threads: "This is about Consent—freedom vs. protection—and Becoming—who Maya is becoming."
Validate Both: "Parents' protection is loving. Maya's autonomy need is healthy. Both are true."
Identify Collapse: "Tighter grip → more pulling away → tighter grip."
Hold Creative Tension: "What would freedom look like that earned more freedom over time?"
Honor Unchosen Pole: Parents: "What YES can we say?" Maya: "What limits can I respect?"
✓ EMERGENCE: "Trust Ladder"—freedoms tied to demonstrated responsibility. Maya participates in setting criteria. Parents commit to evolving their image of who she is. Fights don't disappear but dynamic shifts from control vs. rebellion to collaborative navigation.


CASE STUDY 12
The Treatment Decision
Threads: PAUSE + EMBODIMENT

PRESENTING TENSION
Hospital social worker with Chen family. Mr. Chen (72) has advanced cancer. Options: aggressive treatment (20% chance of extending life by months) or palliative care. Adult children split. Mr. Chen himself oscillates.

POLES IDENTIFIED
PAUSE: NOW
Fight. "Do something. We can't give up."
PAUSE: NOT YET
Accept. "Maybe it's time for letting go."
EMBODIMENT: THINK
Statistics, options. "What do numbers say?"
EMBODIMENT: FEEL
Fear, love, grief. "What does his body know?"

COLLAPSE OBSERVED
⚠ Son → Now + Think: Action = love. Statistics over intuition. Underneath: guilt, fear of loss.
⚠ Daughter → Not Yet + Feel: Acceptance = love. Can't bear watching suffering.

Mr. Chen's oscillation isn't confusion—it's wisdom. He's holding both truths.
ENGAGEMENT STEPS
Arrive: Create space for each family member to name fear and love. No arguments—just witnessing.
Name the Threads: "This involves timing—when to fight, when to release—and head and heart."
Honor the Patient: "Your father's ambivalence may be holding something true neither of you can hold alone."
Surface What's Under: Son: "I'm not ready to lose him." (Feel emerges) Daughter: "I can't watch him suffer." (Think emerges)
Hold Creative Tension: "What care would honor both his will to live AND his readiness to die?"
Return to Center: "Dad, what matters most to you right now?" Let him lead.
✓ EMERGENCE: Mr. Chen chooses limited treatment (honoring will to try) with clear stopping criteria and robust palliative support from start (honoring concern and expressed wishes). Family moves from fighting to supporting father together. Three weeks later, when treatment isn't working, Mr. Chen says, "It's time." Because family had navigated tension together, they were ready.


Using These Cases
These twelve cases demonstrate that the Threads framework applies across radically different contexts—from intimate relationships to corporate boards, from family therapy to community organizing, from spiritual communities to healthcare decisions.
Notice the common pattern:
1. Parties are stuck, often in escalating conflict
2. Each has collapsed toward one pole, losing access to the other
3. Each sees the other as the problem (rather than seeing they're both holding partial truth)
4. Naming the thread shifts from "who's right?" to "what are we both protecting?"
5. Emergence happens when both poles are honored—not when one wins
The facilitator's role is not to solve the tension but to hold space for something new to emerge.
These cases can be used for:
• Training facilitators in the Threads approach
• Illustrating concepts in workshops and presentations
• Personal reflection on your own thread patterns
• Adapting the approach to your specific context
