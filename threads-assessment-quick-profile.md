# Threads Capacity Assessment: Quick Profile

## Overview

The Threads Quick Profile is a 5-minute entry-level assessment designed to give people an initial snapshot of their capacity to hold creative tension across the Seven Threads. This assessment measures *developmental capacity under pressure*—not fixed personality traits—and provides a starting point for focused development work.

**Important:** This assessment reflects your *current* patterns, not permanent characteristics. Capacity can be developed. The goal is awareness that leads to practice.

## Instructions

For each question, choose the response that most honestly reflects how you *actually* respond in challenging moments—not how you wish you responded or think you should respond.

Think of specific recent situations as you answer. There are no "right" answers—only honest ones.

**Rating Scale:**
- **(A)** This is very much like me
- **(B)** This is somewhat like me
- **(C)** This is not much like me
- **(D)** This is not at all like me

## The Assessment

### PRESENCE: The capacity to be here AND with others (Within/Between • Here/Elsewhere)

**Question 1: Genuine Meeting**
> In difficult conversations, I often find I'm relating to a category in my mind ("liberals," "boomers," "my narcissistic mother") rather than the actual person in front of me.

- (A) Very much like me — I'm usually relating to abstractions, not the person
- (B) Somewhat like me — I sometimes catch myself doing this
- (C) Not much like me — I can usually meet the actual person
- (D) Not at all like me — I consistently stay present to the person, not the category

**Question 2: Internal vs. Relational**
> When processing difficult emotions or experiences, I tend to either withdraw completely into solitary processing OR lose myself entirely in seeking others' input—I struggle to move fluidly between the two.

- (A) Very much like me — I collapse into either total isolation or complete enmeshment
- (B) Somewhat like me — I lean heavily one direction but can sometimes access the other
- (C) Not much like me — I can usually balance solitude and connection
- (D) Not at all like me — I move fluidly between internal processing and relational sharing

**Question 3: Present vs. Elsewhere**
> In conversations, my mind is often somewhere else—rehashing the past, planning the future, thinking about other people—rather than being fully here.

- (A) Very much like me — I'm rarely fully present in conversations
- (B) Somewhat like me — I'm often partly elsewhere

- (C) Not much like me — I can usually let people hold different views
- (D) Not at all like me — I consistently allow others their views without needing to change them

**Question 5: Boundaries and Connection**
> When I need to set a boundary or say "no" to someone, I struggle to do so while maintaining the relationship—it feels like I have to choose between my needs and the connection.

- (A) Very much like me — Setting boundaries feels like relationship-ending
- (B) Somewhat like me — It's hard but sometimes I can do both

---

- (C) Not much like me — I can usually distinguish my identity from inherited narratives
- (D) Not at all like me — I consistently see inherited stories as perspectives, not identity

## Scoring Guide

### How to Score

For each Thread, assign points to your three answers:
- **(A)** = 1 point (lowest capacity / highest collapse tendency)
- **(B)** = 2 points
- **(C)** = 3 points
- **(D)** = 4 points (highest capacity / lowest collapse tendency)

**Note:** Some questions are reverse-scored (Questions 8, 14, 18, 20). For these questions:
- **(A)** = 1 point (still lowest capacity)
- **(B)** = 2 points
- **(C)** = 3 points
- **(D)** = 4 points (still highest capacity)

*The reverse-scored questions are phrased positively, so (D) "Very much like me" still indicates high capacity.*

### Calculate Your Thread Scores

| Thread | Questions | Your Score (3-12) |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| PRESENCE | Q1, Q2, Q3 | ____ |
| CONSENT | Q4, Q5, Q6 | ____ |
| MEMORY | Q7, Q8, Q9 | ____ |
| PAUSE | Q10, Q11, Q12 | ____ |
| EMBODIMENT | Q13, Q14, Q15 | ____ |
| UNCERTAINTY | Q16, Q17, Q18 | ____ |
| BECOMING | Q19, Q20, Q21 | ____ |

### Interpreting Your Scores

**For each Thread:**

| Score | Capacity Level | What This Means |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| 10-12 | High | Strong capacity; collapse is rare |
| 7-9 | Moderate | Some capacity; collapse under high pressure |
| 4-6 | Low | Frequent collapse; targeted development needed |
| 3 | Very Low | Consistent collapse; priority for development |

## Understanding Your Results: See. Hold. Emerge.

The seven Threads organize into three movements that mirror how transformation actually works:

### SEE (Orienting - Threads 1-4)
**You locate where you are in the tension**

Calculate your SEE average:
```
SEE Average = (PRESENCE + CONSENT + MEMORY + PAUSE) ÷ 4 = ____
```

- **High (10-12):** Strong self-awareness and relational clarity
- **Moderate (7-9):** Developing awareness; occasional blind spots
- **Low (4-6):** Difficulty seeing patterns as they happen
- **Very Low (3):** Operating mostly unconsciously in tensions

**What this means:** The SEE threads help you orient—to know where you are internally (PRESENCE), what boundaries exist (CONSENT), what stories are running (MEMORY), and what timing is appropriate (PAUSE). If your SEE average is low, you may struggle to even recognize when you're in tension or collapse.

---

### HOLD (Sourcing - Threads 5-6)
**You receive what body and mystery know**

Calculate your HOLD average:
```
HOLD Average = (EMBODIMENT + UNCERTAINTY) ÷ 2 = ____
```

- **High (10-12):** Strong capacity to stay with not-knowing and embodied presence
- **Moderate (7-9):** Can access body wisdom and uncertainty, but not always under pressure
- **Low (4-6):** Frequently escape into thought or certainty
- **Very Low (3):** Disconnected from body; threatened by mystery

**What this means:** The HOLD threads are about sourcing wisdom from below thought—from what the body knows (EMBODIMENT) and what mystery reveals (UNCERTAINTY). If your HOLD average is low, you may struggle to access intuition, body wisdom, or remain open to not-knowing.

---

### EMERGE (Integrating - Thread 7)
**You become what's next**

Your BECOMING score: ____

- **High (10-12):** Fluid identity; transformation feels natural
- **Moderate (7-9):** Some flexibility; can change but with difficulty
- **Low (4-6):** Identity feels fixed; change feels like betrayal
- **Very Low (3):** Stuck in rigid identity or endless reinvention

**What this means:** BECOMING is where SEE and HOLD integrate into actual transformation. You can see clearly AND stay with mystery AND allow yourself to change. If BECOMING is low but SEE and HOLD are higher, you may have the capacity but fear using it. If BECOMING is high but SEE and HOLD are low, you may be changing without integration—spiritual bypass.

## What's Next?

This Quick Profile gives you a starting point. For deeper understanding:

1. **Review your lowest scores** — These are your priority Threads for development
2. **Notice your movement patterns** — Is SEE, HOLD, or EMERGE weakest?
3. **Begin HOLD practice** — Use HOLD to catch collapses in real-time
4. **Consider the Extended Assessment** — For more nuanced understanding
5. **Track over time** — Retake monthly to observe development

Your capacity to hold creative tension can grow. This profile shows where you are. Practice determines where you go.

## HOLD Practice Focus

Based on your lowest Thread, focus your HOLD practice here:

| If Lowest Thread Is... | Your HOLD Focus | Why This Helps |
|------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **PRESENCE** | **H + O** — HALT to notice where you are; OBSERVE body to ground presence | PRESENCE collapse means you're either lost in isolation or enmeshed—HALT brings awareness, OBSERVE grounds you |
| **CONSENT** | **L** — LOOK for the tension between "my truth" and "your autonomy" | CONSENT collapse means you're forcing agreement or cutting off—L helps you find the "both/and" |
| **MEMORY** | **L** — LOOK for inherited narratives appearing; notice "given" vs. "chosen" | MEMORY collapse means stories possess you—L helps you see them as perspectives not identity |
| **PAUSE** | **H** — Practice the HALT step; create longer pauses before response | PAUSE collapse means impulsivity or procrastination—H interrupts both patterns |
| **EMBODIMENT** | **O** — Practice the OBSERVE step; build body awareness consistently | EMBODIMENT collapse means you're in your head or flooded—O trains you to stay grounded |
| **UNCERTAINTY** | **L** — Practice LOOK; find "certain AND might be wrong" tension | UNCERTAINTY collapse means false certainty or paralytic doubt—L opens mystery |
| **BECOMING** | **D** — Practice DECIDE; focus on "who do I want to become?" | BECOMING collapse means stuck identity or rootless flux—D helps you choose transformation |

### Movement-Based Practice

**If SEE is weakest overall:**
- **Practice:** Daily "Where am I?" check-in
- **Focus:** HALT (H) + OBSERVE (O) to build awareness
- **Goal:** Notice tensions as they arise, not just in retrospect

**If HOLD is weakest overall:**
- **Practice:** Body scans + sitting with not-knowing
- **Focus:** OBSERVE (O) + mystery tolerance
- **Goal:** Source wisdom from below thought

**If EMERGE (BECOMING) is weakest:**
- **Practice:** "Who am I becoming?" journaling
- **Focus:** DECIDE (D) from fullness, not fear
- **Goal:** Allow transformation without betrayal or rootlessness
