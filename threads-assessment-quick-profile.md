# Threads Capacity Assessment: Quick Profile

## Overview

The Threads Quick Profile is a 5-minute entry-level assessment designed to give people an initial snapshot of their capacity to hold creative tension across the Seven Threads. This assessment measures *developmental capacity under pressure*—not fixed personality traits—and provides a starting point for focused development work.

**Important:** This assessment reflects your *current* patterns, not permanent characteristics. Capacity can be developed. The goal is awareness that leads to practice.

## Instructions

For each question, choose the response that most honestly reflects how you *actually* respond in challenging moments—not how you wish you responded or think you should respond.

Think of specific recent situations as you answer. There are no "right" answers—only honest ones.

**Rating Scale:**
- **(A)** This is very much like me
- **(B)** This is somewhat like me  
- **(C)** This is not much like me
- **(D)** This is not at all like me

## The Assessment

### PAUSE: The capacity to create space between stimulus and response

**Question 1: Reactive vs. Responsive**

- (B) Somewhat like me — I feel urgency but can sometimes resist it
- (C) Not much like me — I can usually wait even when it's uncomfortable

## Scoring Guide

### How to Score

For each Thread, assign points to your three answers:
- **(A)** = 1 point (lowest capacity / highest collapse tendency)
- **(B)** = 2 points
- **(C)** = 3 points  
- **(D)** = 4 points (highest capacity / lowest collapse tendency)

**Note:** Some questions are reverse-scored (Questions 5, 14, 18, 20, 21). For these questions:
- **(A)** = 1 point (still lowest capacity)
- **(B)** = 2 points
- **(C)** = 3 points
- **(D)** = 4 points (still highest capacity)

*The reverse-scored questions are phrased positively, so (D) "Very much like me" still indicates high capacity.*

## What's Next?

This Quick Profile gives you a starting point. For deeper understanding:

1. **Review your lowest scores** — These are your priority Threads for development
2. **Notice your patterns** — Do certain Threads cluster together?
3. **Begin HOLD practice** — Use HOLD to catch collapses in real-time
4. **Consider the Extended Assessment** — For more nuanced understanding
5. **Track over time** — Retake monthly to observe development

Your capacity to hold creative tension can grow. This profile shows where you are. Practice determines where you go.

**Your HOLD Focus:**
Based on your lowest Thread, focus your HOLD practice here:

| If Lowest Thread Is... | Your HOLD Focus |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| PAUSE | **H** — Practice the HALT step; create longer pauses |
| EMBODIMENT | **O** — Practice the OBSERVE step; build body awareness |
| CONSENT | **L** — Practice LOOK; find the tension between "right" and "connected" |
| THRESHOLD | **L** — Practice LOOK; identify what discomfort you're avoiding |
| MEMORY | **L** — Practice LOOK; notice inherited narratives appearing |
