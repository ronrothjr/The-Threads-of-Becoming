# S.A.F.E. Public Measurement & Celebration

**Making S.A.F.E. actions visible, valued, and celebrated**

---

## The Principle

**What gets measured gets done. What gets celebrated gets repeated.**

S.A.F.E. success isn't hidden in counselor offices or incident reports—it's displayed publicly, celebrated loudly, and tracked transparently. When students see their collective progress toward becoming a S.A.F.E. community, they become agents of that change.

**The Shift:** From "How many bullying incidents occurred?" (shame-based, punitive) to "How many S.A.F.E. actions did we take?" (growth-based, celebratory). We're not counting failures—we're counting courage.

## The S.A.F.E. Board

### 📊 Weekly Visual Tracking (Main Hallway)

**What It Looks Like:**
Large 6-foot display board near main entrance with four sections:

#### 1. This Week's Focus Thread
Large visual of the thread (e.g., "CONSENT: Who gets to choose?") with explanation and examples

#### 2. S.A.F.E. Actions Counter
Three running tallies (updated daily):
- **Inclusion Actions:** "This week: 34 | This year: 412"
- **Witness/Ask Actions:** "This week: 21 | This year: 287"
- **Self-Awareness Actions:** "This week: 18 | This year: 203"

#### 3. Incident Count (Transparent)
Simple graph showing weekly incidents:
- Exclusion incidents (green bars—trending down is good)
- Unkind words incidents (blue bars)
- Physical aggression (red bars—SEE & ACT invoked)

*Note: Numbers only, no names. Goal is transparency, not shame.*

#### 4. Featured S.A.F.E. Story
One student-written story per week (with permission) describing a S.A.F.E. action they took or witnessed

**Who Updates It:**
- **Office staff:** Daily tally updates (5 minutes/day)
- **Student council:** Weekly story selection and posting
- **Principal:** Friday assembly shout-out referencing the board

## S.A.F.E. Slips System

### What Are S.A.F.E. Slips?

Small cards (3x5) available everywhere—classrooms, cafeteria, office, library—that anyone can fill out to recognize a S.A.F.E. action they took or witnessed.

**The Card Has:**
- **Who:** Name of person who took S.A.F.E. action (optional for self-report)
- **What I Saw/Did:** Brief description
- **Type of Action:** ☐ Inclusion ☐ Witness/Ask ☐ Self-Awareness
- **Thread Involved:** (optional, if they can name it)
- **Submitted by:** Name or anonymous

---

### Three Types of S.A.F.E. Actions

#### 1. Inclusion Actions
*When patterns of exclusion happen, students voluntarily include someone*

**Examples:**
- "I saw Maya sitting alone, so I asked if she wanted to sit with us"
- "Jamal wasn't picked for the team, so I said we should pick him next"
- "I noticed the new kid didn't have a partner, so I partnered with them"

#### 2. Witness/Ask Actions
*When unkind words are said, students ask about hurt instead of ignoring or escalating*

**Examples:**
- "I heard someone call Aisha a name, so I asked if she was okay"
- "I saw two kids arguing and asked what they both needed"
- "My friend was spreading rumors, so I asked why they were doing that"

#### 3. Self-Awareness Actions
*Students voice feelings about what they're doing, needing, or wanting to become*

**Examples:**
- "I was about to exclude someone, but I noticed and chose differently"
- "I felt hurt when they left me out, so I said 'I feel left out' instead of being mean back"
- "I wanted to say something mean, but I paused and asked myself who I want to be"

---

### What Happens to S.A.F.E. Slips?

#### Daily Process:
- **Collection:** Office staff collect from drop boxes each afternoon
- **Review:** Counselor reviews for patterns (5 min/day)
- **Data Entry:** Office staff tally by type in tracking system
- **Selection:** Student council picks 5-7 to read at Friday assembly

#### Monthly Process:
- **Classroom tallies:** Each class gets report of their S.A.F.E. actions
- **Individual recognition:** Students with 3+ slips get certificate
- **S.A.F.E. Wall:** Top 10 slips posted in main hallway

---

### Digital Option (Grades 3+)

Google Form or simple app where students can submit S.A.F.E. slips digitally

**Benefits:**
- Easier data tracking
- Anonymous submissions more comfortable for some
- Instant tallies for S.A.F.E. Board
- Can include photos of S.A.F.E. action (with permission)

**Considerations:**
- Not all students have device access—keep paper option
- Younger students may prefer tactile card experience
- Digital can feel less personal—balance both

## Monthly S.A.F.E. Assemblies

### Whole-School Celebration (30 minutes, Last Friday of Month)

#### Assembly Flow:

**1. Welcome & S.A.F.E. Board Review (5 min)**

## Public Incident Dashboard

### Transparency Builds Accountability

**What Gets Published (Monthly)** - On school website and in newsletter:

#### Incidents (Numbers Only)
- **Exclusion incidents:** 14 this month (down from 23 last month)
- **Unkind words incidents:** 8 this month (up from 6 last month)
- **Physical aggression:** 2 this month (same as last month)

#### S.A.F.E. Actions (Celebrate!)
- **Inclusion actions:** 67 this month
- **Witness/Ask actions:** 42 this month
- **Self-awareness actions:** 28 this month
- **Total:** 137 S.A.F.E. actions!

**Why Publish Incident Numbers?**
- **Honesty:** We don't hide problems—we face them together
- **Context:** Families see the full picture, not just what their kid reports
- **Accountability:** Public tracking means staff can't ignore patterns
- **Progress:** Over time, families see the culture shifting

**Important:** Never publish names associated with incidents. Numbers only. Privacy protected, patterns revealed.

## The S.A.F.E. Wall

### Permanent Visual in Main Hallway

**What It Is:**
Large bulletin board displaying:
- **Top 10 S.A.F.E. Slips of the Month** (full text, with student names/photos if permission given)
- **Year-to-Date Stats** (running totals of S.A.F.E. actions by type)
- **Thread Spotlight** (current month's focus Thread with student reflections)
- **S.A.F.E. Pledge** signed by all students at start of year

**Who Maintains It:**
- Student council (monthly updates)
- Art teacher (design/layout support)
- Custodian (ensures materials stay posted)

**Impact:**
- Every family sees it at pickup/drop-off
- Visitors ask about it (school pride moment)
- Students look for their names/friends' names
- Creates visual culture of "we're a S.A.F.E. school"

---

## Class-Level Tracking

### Classroom S.A.F.E. Charts

**What Teachers Display:**
- **Class S.A.F.E. Actions:** Chart with three columns (Inclusion, Witness/Ask, Self-Awareness)
- **Weekly Goal:** "Can we reach 15 S.A.F.E. actions this week?"
- **Student Reflections:** Post-its where students write about S.A.F.E. moments

**Not Competitive:**
Classes aren't competing against each other for prizes—they're celebrating their own growth. Recognition at assembly, yes. Rewards/incentives, no.

---

### Individual Student Tracking (Private)

**What Teachers Keep:**
- Simple spreadsheet or binder with student names
- Tally of S.A.F.E. slips submitted about/by each student
- Patterns teacher notices (who's struggling, who's flourishing)

**When to Intervene:**
- **Zero S.A.F.E. slips after 3 weeks:** One-on-one check-in
- **Multiple incident reports:** Counselor referral, parent contact
- **High S.A.F.E. engagement:** Leadership opportunity (safety patrol, student council)

---

### Monthly Class Debrief (20 minutes, End of Month)

**Class Reflection Circle**
Teacher facilitates:
- "What S.A.F.E. actions did we take this month?"
- "What tensions are we still learning to hold?"
- "What do we want to practice next month?"

**Data Share**
Teacher shows class their numbers:
- "We had 23 S.A.F.E. actions this month! That's up from 18 last month."
- "We also had 4 exclusion incidents. What can we learn from that?"

## What Success Looks Like

### ⚠️ Before S.A.F.E.
- High incident reports, staff overwhelmed
- Students don't report conflicts (fear of being snitch)
- Reactive discipline (punish after harm done)
- Victim/bully binary (good kid vs. bad kid)
- Parents defensive when contacted
- Recess monitors breaking up fights constantly
- Cafeteria exclusion rampant, unaddressed

### ✅ After 1 Year of S.A.F.E.
- Incident reports decline 40-60%
- S.A.F.E. slips submitted regularly (150+/month)
- Proactive culture (students intervene before escalation)
- Tension-holding language (everyone's learning, everyone's becoming)
- Parents use S.A.F.E. language at home
- Recess monitors facilitate, not just intervene
- Cafeteria staff report visible inclusion efforts
