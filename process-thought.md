# **Process Thought: A Universal Primer**

This is Process Thought at its finest \- even the description of process must remain in process.

## **Process Theology Introduction**

Process Theology, emerging from Alfred North Whitehead's philosophical work in the 1920s, understands reality as composed of events and relationships in continuous creative becoming rather than fixed substances or states. This perspective suggests that everything—from quantum particles to human communities—exists in dynamic process, inheriting its past while remaining genuinely open to novel possibilities. 

Rather than viewing conflict as dysfunction to be resolved, Process thought sees creative tension as the very engine of transformation: stability and change, individual and collective, freedom and belonging are not opposites to choose between but polarities that generate new possibilities through their interaction. The divine (however understood) works not through coercive power but through persuasion—offering possibilities that "lure" creation toward greater beauty, complexity, and harmony. 

The Threads of Becoming translates these abstract Process concepts into practical, embodied practices for personal and communal transformation, making Whitehead's insight that "the many become one and are increased by one" into lived experience through creative engagement with tension rather than resolution of it.

### **What Is Process Thought?**

Process thought suggests that reality isn't made of fixed things but of events, experiences, and relationships in constant creative movement. Everything \- from atoms to ecosystems to human communities \- is continuously becoming something new while carrying forward what has been.

Whether you believe in God, many gods, or no gods at all, process thought offers a framework for understanding how:

* Change and stability coexist  
* Past influences without determining present  
* Future remains genuinely open  
* Everything is interconnected  
* Creativity emerges from tension

### **Core Insights for Everyone**

**1\. You Are Not a Thing But an Event**

You aren't a static self but a continuous process of becoming. Each moment, you inherit your past (memories, habits, cells), encounter new possibilities, and choose what to become next. You're both continuous with who you were and free to become something new.

*This matters for conflict because: People can change. Past behavior informs but doesn't imprison.*

**2\. Everything Is Interconnected**

Nothing exists in isolation. Every entity \- person, community, ecosystem \- is constituted by its relationships. You literally wouldn't be who you are without everyone and everything that has touched your life.

*This matters because: Harm to one truly is harm to all. Healing one contributes to healing all.*

**3\. The Future Is Open**

The past is fixed (it happened), but it doesn't determine the future. Each moment contains genuine novelty \- the possibility for something unprecedented to emerge. Creativity isn't rare; it's how reality works.

*This matters because: No conflict is permanently stuck. New possibilities always exist.*

**4\. Experience Goes All the Way Down**

Some form of experience (not consciousness, but response-to-environment) exists at every level of reality. An electron "experiences" forces. A plant "experiences" sun. This isn't anthropomorphism but recognition that interiority exists everywhere.

*This matters because: We can respect the subjective experience of all beings, not just humans.*

### **The Universal Dynamics**

**Inheritance and Innovation**

Every moment, you:

1. **Receive** the past (what has been)  
2. **Encounter** possibilities (what could be)  
3. **Decide** what to become (what will be)  
4. **Contribute** to the future (what you pass on)

This happens in milliseconds, continuously. You're always in process.

**Creative Tension as Natural**

Tension isn't dysfunction but the engine of creativity:

* Stability AND change  
* Individual AND collective  
* Freedom AND constraint  
* Order AND novelty

These aren't problems to solve but dynamics to navigate.

### **For Different Worldviews**

**If You're Atheist/Humanist:** Process thought requires no supernatural beliefs. It's a naturalistic philosophy describing how complexity, consciousness, and creativity emerge from the interplay of events. Think of it as evolution applied to every moment \- variation, selection, inheritance, but at the speed of experience.

**If You're Theist:** Your tradition's understanding of divine action can be enriched by seeing God not as controlling but as offering possibilities, working through persuasion not coercion. Different traditions will interpret this differently, and that's appropriate.

**If You're Agnostic:** Process thought stays open about ultimate questions while offering practical insights about how change happens. You don't need to decide about God to recognize that reality is processual.

**If You're Buddhist:** The emphasis on impermanence, dependent origination, and the absence of fixed self resonates deeply. Process thought offers a Western philosophical framework for insights your tradition has long held.

**If You're Indigenous:** The recognition that everything is alive, related, and deserving of respect aligns with many Indigenous worldviews. Process thought is one way settler culture is slowly learning what you've always known.

**If You're "Spiritual But Not Religious":** Process thought provides intellectual framework for intuitions about connection, growth, and the sacred in ordinary experience without requiring specific beliefs.

### **Practical Applications**

**In Conflict:**

* No one is fixed in their position  
* Everyone is influenced by their past but not determined by it  
* New possibilities exist that neither party has imagined  
* The relationship itself can become something new

**In Community:**

* The group is not a thing but an event continuously recreated  
* Each gathering is both continuation and new creation  
* Conflict is information about what wants to emerge  
* Change happens through invitation, not force

**In Personal Growth:**

* You're not broken needing fixing but in process of becoming  
* Your past influences but doesn't imprison you  
* Each moment offers fresh possibilities  
* Growth happens through creative tension, not despite it

---

### **The Both/And Practice**

Instead of either/or thinking, practice both/and:

* "I am the same person AND I'm becoming someone new"  
* "This tradition is valuable AND it needs to evolve"  
* "We need individual freedom AND community belonging"  
* "This conflict is painful AND it contains possibility"

---

### **Why This Matters in Everyday Life**

Process thinking suggests:

1. **Transformation is always possible** \- people and communities can genuinely change  
2. **Coercion doesn't work** \- transformation happens through invitation and persuasion  
3. **Everything affects everything** \- healing individuals heals community and vice versa  
4. **The past matters but doesn't determine** \- we honor history without being trapped by it  
5. **Conflict is creative** \- tension generates new possibilities

### **An Invitation, Not a Requirement**

You don't have to "believe in" process thought to use its insights. Like gravity, the dynamics it describes operate whether you believe in them or not. Take what serves, leave what doesn't. Add your own insights. The framework itself is in process, becoming what we make of it together.

---

### **The Simplest Summary**

Everything is in process. Nothing is final. The past influences but doesn't determine. The future is open. We're all connected. Change happens through invitation, not force. Creative tension drives transformation.

This is true whether you explain it through quantum physics, divine action, evolutionary biology, or ancient wisdom. The framework is universal; the interpretation is personal.

*"We are not nouns but verbs. Not things but processes. Not beings but becomings. And in this continuous creation, we find both freedom and connection, both continuity and novelty, both tension and transformation."*
