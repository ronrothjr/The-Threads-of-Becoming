  
THE THREADS OF BECOMING

**Community of Practice**  
**Guidelines**

*Structures for Ongoing Learning, Connection, and Growth*

For Certified Threads Practitioners (CTP)  
and Certified Threads Facilitators (CTF)

The Creative Advance Institute • Version 1.0

# **Introduction**

Certification is a beginning, not an end. The Threads of Becoming framework is alive—it grows through the collective wisdom of those who practice it. The Community of Practice exists to nurture that growth.

*"We don't just learn the framework and then apply it. We continue learning through application, and our learning advances the framework itself."*

## **Why Community Matters**

Without ongoing community engagement, practitioners risk isolation, stagnation, burnout, and blind spots that go unchallenged.

With community engagement, practitioners gain continuous learning, support for challenging cases, accountability, contribution to framework development, and professional relationships that enrich the work.

| **Peer Consultation Groups** | Small groups (4-6) meeting regularly for case consultation |
| **Special Interest Groups** | Context-specific: clinical, congregational, organizational, coaching |
