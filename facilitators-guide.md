# **PART ONE: FOUNDATIONS**

## **Chapter 1: Understanding the Framework**

### **What the Threads Are**

The Threads of Becoming is a diagnostic and intervention framework built around seven universal tensions that appear in every human system—couples, teams, congregations, organizations, and individuals in transition. Unlike frameworks that treat conflict as a problem to solve, this approach treats tension as the engine of all growth and transformation.

**The seven threads are:**

* PRESENCE: Who's there? — Tensions of solitude and connection, attention and distraction

* CONSENT: May I? — Tensions of permission and sovereignty, yes and no

* MEMORY: What happened? — Tensions of inherited and chosen story, narrator and character

* PAUSE: Why do we wait here? — Tensions of timing, urgency, and sufficiency

* EMBODIMENT: How does my body know? — Tensions of thinking and feeling, presence and flight

* UNCERTAINTY: What is the mystery unveiling? — Tensions of knowing and not-knowing, threat and wonder

* BECOMING: Who am I now? — Tensions of continuity and change, return and forward movement

### **The Core Insight**

Every thread contains two or more poles that exist in creative tension. These poles are not problems to solve but polarities to navigate. When we collapse toward one pole—treating it as the answer rather than half of a living tension—we lose the creative potential that emerges only when both poles are honored.

| THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE Tension, held without collapse, becomes the birthplace of the genuinely new. Your role as facilitator is not to resolve the tension but to help people stay in it long enough for something to emerge that neither pole could produce alone. |
| :---- |

### **How This Differs from Problem-Solving**

Traditional approaches to conflict ask: "What's wrong and how do we fix it?" The Threads framework asks: "What tension is alive here, and what is it trying to birth?"

| Problem-Solving Mode | Creative Tension Mode |
| ----- | ----- |
| "Someone is wrong" Win/lose or compromise Resolve tension quickly Fix the presenting issue | "Both poles carry truth" Transcend and include Hold tension productively Transform the underlying pattern |

### **The Philosophical Foundation**

This framework draws from Process Philosophy (Whitehead), which holds that reality is not made of static things but of dynamic processes of becoming. Every moment is a new arising. Transformation isn't an event but the nature of existence itself.

Three key Process insights inform this work:

* Creative Advance: Reality moves forward. Even returning to familiar ground, something genuinely new is possible.

* Concrescence: Many things flow together to become one new thing. Holding multiple truths without forcing premature unity allows this flowing-together.

* Novelty: The universe is not just rearranging old pieces but generating the genuinely unprecedented. Your facilitation creates conditions for emergence.

## **Chapter 2: Entering the Work**

### **The Facilitator's Stance**

Before working with threads, understand your role. You are not:

* A problem-solver with answers

* A referee deciding who's right

* A therapist (unless you are one)

* Responsible for outcomes

You are:

* A witness to what's alive

* A holder of space where tension can be named

* A diagnostician of collapse

* A gentle guide back toward the living tension

| YOUR FIRST TASK Before every session, ask yourself: "Am I trying to fix this, or am I trying to hold space for what wants to emerge?" If the answer is "fix," pause until you can genuinely release the outcome. |
| :---- |

### **Thread Selection: Finding the Entry Point**

Every situation involves multiple threads. Your task is not to address all of them but to find the thread that's most alive right now—the one where intervention will create the most movement.

**The Thread Selection Process:**

1. Listen for the seed question. What question is the person or system actually asking, beneath the surface issue?

2. Watch for activation signals—behavioral, relational, and somatic cues that indicate which thread is activated.

3. Test with a diagnostic question. If it lands, you've found your thread. If not, try another.

4. Name the thread without forcing it. "It sounds like there's something here about permission..." If they agree, proceed. If not, keep listening.

### **The Thread Selection Decision Tree**

| If you're hearing... | Enter through... |
| :---- | :---- |
| "They're not really here" / "I need space" / "We're disconnected" | **PRESENCE** |
| "I felt pressured" / "They decided for me" / "I can't say no" | **CONSENT** |
| "This is just like when..." / "In my family..." / "They always..." | **MEMORY** |
| "We need to decide now" / "I've been stuck for months" / "Is this enough?" | **PAUSE** |
| "I don't know what I feel" / "My body says no" / "I'm numb" | **EMBODIMENT** |
| "What if we're wrong?" / "I need to be sure" / "I can't know that" | **UNCERTAINTY** |
| "I don't know who I am anymore" / "Am I really different?" / "Major transition" | **BECOMING** |

| WHEN IN DOUBT: START WITH EMBODIMENT If you're uncertain which thread to enter, try EMBODIMENT first. The body often knows before the mind which thread is most alive. "What's happening in your body right now?" frequently reveals the entry point. |

# **PART TWO: THE SESSION**

## **Chapter 3: Session Structure**

### **The Basic Arc**

A typical session using the Threads framework follows a four-phase arc. This can happen in 20 minutes or two hours, but the phases remain the same.

**Phase 1: ARRIVE (2-5 minutes)**

* Establish presence—yours and theirs

* Brief orientation: "What's alive for you right now?"

* Listen for which thread is activated

* Don't rush this. Arrival is its own work.

**Phase 2: NAME (3-10 minutes)**

* Identify the thread: "It sounds like there's something here about..."

* Name the poles: "I hear you pulled toward X, and also toward Y"

* Use diagnostic questions to deepen understanding

* Watch for collapse signs—are they stuck in one pole?

**Phase 3: HOLD (5-30 minutes)**

* The core work: help them stay in tension without collapsing

* Use the micro-intervention for that thread

* Validate both poles: neither is wrong

* Watch for emergence—something new trying to arise

* Transition to other threads as needed

**Phase 4: INTEGRATE (2-5 minutes)**

* Name what emerged: "What's different now?"

* Don't force resolution—partial emergence is real

* Identify next step (if any): smallest action

* Close with presence: arrive together before departing

### **Working with Multiple Threads**

Most real situations involve multiple threads. The skill is knowing when to stay with one thread and when to transition.

Signs to stay with the current thread:

* Energy is still moving

* Diagnostic questions are landing

* Person/group is engaged

* Emergence feels possible

Signs to transition to another thread:

* Current thread has gone as far as it can

* A different thread keeps surfacing

* You hit a wall—movement stopped

* The person explicitly names something that indicates another thread

**Transition language:**

*"As we talk about \[current thread\], I'm noticing something about \[new thread\]. Would it be okay to follow that?"*

*"The question of \[current seed\] seems connected to \[new seed\]. Is that true for you?"*

### **The Thread Transition Map**

Each protocol includes specific transition cues. Here are the most common pathways:

| From | When you notice... | Move to |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Any thread | They can't feel their body, living in their head | **EMBODIMENT** |
| Any thread | Old patterns, family stories, past wounds surfacing | **MEMORY** |
| Any thread | Questions of permission, sovereignty, coercion | **CONSENT** |
| BECOMING | Integration complete, new self showing up | **PRESENCE** |

| THE EMBODIMENT GATEWAY EMBODIMENT is often the threshold thread. The body must be accessible before other work can go deep. If you're stuck in any thread, try grounding in the body first. "What's happening in your body right now?" frequently unlocks what thinking cannot. |
| :---- |

## **Chapter 4: Working with Collapse**

### **Recognizing Collapse**

Collapse happens when someone (or a system) stops holding the tension between poles and falls into treating one pole as the whole truth. This is the most important diagnostic skill in this work.

General signs of collapse:

* Rigidity: "This is just how it is"

* Either/or thinking: one pole is right, the other is wrong

* Urgency to resolve rather than hold

* Defending rather than exploring

* Body armoring: tension, holding, bracing

### **The Collapse-Recovery Cycle**

Collapse is not failure. It's information. Every collapse shows you which pole someone is running to for safety—and therefore which pole feels threatening. This is diagnostic gold.

1. Notice the collapse without judgment: "I notice you've landed firmly in \[pole\]."

2. Validate the pole they've collapsed into: "There's real wisdom in \[pole\]. It's not wrong."

3. Gently introduce the other pole: "And I wonder what \[other pole\] might have to offer here too."

4. Return to the living tension: "What would it be like to hold both?"

| CAUTION: DON'T FORCE THE OTHER POLE When someone has collapsed into one pole, they've often done so for good reason—the other pole feels unsafe. Forcing them toward it too quickly can trigger shutdown or defensive escalation. Honor the protective function of their collapse before inviting them back into tension. |
| :---- |

### **Collapse Patterns by Thread**

Each thread has characteristic collapse patterns. See the Reference Cards for complete collapse signs. Here are the most common:

**PRESENCE:**

* Toward WITHIN: Isolation as identity, connection feels threatening

* Toward BETWEEN: Can't be alone, identity dissolves without relationship

**CONSENT:**

* Toward YES: Chronic people-pleasing, can't access "no"

* Toward NO: Walls instead of boundaries, autonomy weaponized

**MEMORY:**

* Toward GIVEN: Loyalty to harmful inherited stories

* Toward CHOSEN: Cutting off from history without integration

**PAUSE:**

* Toward NOT YET: Perfectionism, waiting becomes permanent

* Toward NOW: Acting to relieve anxiety, manufactured urgency

**EMBODIMENT:**

* Toward THINK: Living from neck up, emotions analyzed not felt

* Toward FEEL: Overwhelmed by sensation, chronic reactivity

**UNCERTAINTY:**

* Toward HIDE: Clinging to certainties, "I'd rather not know"

* Toward SEEK: Compulsive information gathering, analysis paralysis

**BECOMING:**

* Toward SAME: "People don't change," clinging to outdated identity

* Toward DIFFERENT: Serial reinvention without integration

# **PART THREE: APPLICATIONS**

## **Chapter 5: Context-Specific Applications**

### **Working with Couples**

In couples work, the threads often manifest as relational patterns where each partner has collapsed toward opposite poles—creating a locked system.

**Common couple patterns:**

* PRESENCE: Pursuer/Distancer dynamic (Between vs. Within)

* CONSENT: Controller/Appeaser dynamic (Self vs. Other sovereignty)

* MEMORY: Competing narratives about shared history

* PAUSE: One wants to decide now, one needs more time

Key move: Help each partner see the wisdom in the other's pole, rather than defending their own.

**Example script:**

*"Sarah, when James asks for space, there's real wisdom in that—he might need solitude to bring his full presence back. James, when Sarah reaches for connection, there's wisdom there too—togetherness is how she processes. Neither of you is wrong. The question is: what would 'enough' look like for both of you right now?"*

### **Working with Teams and Organizations**

Organizational conflicts often involve systemic collapse—the whole culture has fallen into one pole.

**Common organizational patterns:**

* PAUSE: Cultures of manufactured urgency OR analysis paralysis

* CONSENT: Top-down decisions made "for" people vs. endless consensus-seeking

* UNCERTAINTY: Risk-averse cultures vs. reckless "move fast" cultures

* MEMORY: "We've always done it this way" vs. constant reinvention

Key move: Name the cultural collapse without blame, then introduce the missing pole as a resource, not a threat.

### **Working with Communities**

Community conflict often involves competing narratives about shared memory, contested questions of who belongs (PRESENCE), and disagreements about timing (PAUSE).

**Key principles for community work:**

* Name the thread explicitly: "This congregation is wrestling with a MEMORY question—whose story will we tell about our history?"

* Validate all poles publicly: Create space for multiple truths

* Use fishbowl or structured dialogue to prevent collapse into factions

* Expect longer timelines: Community threads take months or years, not sessions

### **Working with Individuals**

In individual coaching or pastoral work, the threads often reveal internal conflicts—parts of self at odds with other parts.

Key adaptation: Externalize the poles as "parts" or "voices."

**Example script:**

*"It sounds like there's a part of you that needs certainty before you can act, and another part that knows you'll never be certain enough. Both of these are trying to protect you. What would it be like to let them both have a voice?"*

## **Chapter 6: Case Studies**

### **Case Study 1: The Couples Session (PRESENCE → CONSENT)**

*Presenting issue: Maria complains James is "never really here." James says Maria is "suffocating."*

**The facilitator recognizes this as PRESENCE (Within ↔ Between). Rather than siding with either, they name the tension:**

*"Maria, you need togetherness to feel connected. James, you need solitude to bring your full self. Both of these are legitimate needs. Neither of you is wrong. The question is: what would 'enough' look like for each of you?"*

**As they explore, James mentions feeling "pressured" when Maria asks him to talk. The facilitator notices this and transitions to CONSENT:**

*"James, I'm hearing something about pressure—like your 'yes' to connection doesn't feel fully free. Maria, would it be okay to explore that for a moment?"*

**The session moves from PRESENCE to CONSENT, uncovering that James's withdrawal is partly about protecting his sovereignty. Maria realizes her pursuit has inadvertently made his "yes" feel coerced. They leave with a new practice: Maria asks, "Would you like to talk?" James practices saying "not yet" without it meaning rejection.**

### **Case Study 2: The Team Decision (PAUSE → UNCERTAINTY)**

*Presenting issue: A leadership team has been debating a strategic decision for six months. Half want to "just decide"; half want "more data."*

**The facilitator recognizes this as PAUSE (Not Yet ↔ Now) and tests with a diagnostic question:**

*"I want to ask something that might feel strange: Is this urgency to decide coming from the situation—or from inside this room? And for those who want more time—is that wisdom or avoidance?"*

**The room gets quiet. Both sides recognize some truth in the questions. As they explore, it becomes clear the real issue isn't timing—it's that no one wants to own a decision that might be wrong. The facilitator transitions to UNCERTAINTY:**

*"It sounds like the question isn't 'when to decide' but 'how to decide without certainty.' What's the fear if this decision turns out to be wrong?"*

**This opens a deeper conversation about risk tolerance, accountability, and what they actually can and cannot know. They don't resolve the decision, but they agree to a "reversibility check"—making a provisional decision with clear milestones to reassess. Both poles (act now / wait for certainty) are honored.**

### **Case Study 3: The Ministry Transition (BECOMING → MEMORY)**

*Presenting issue: A pastor of 25 years has "lost the fire" and doesn't know who he'd be without the pulpit.*

**The facilitator recognizes this as BECOMING (Same ↔ Different, Return ↔ Forward) and uses the mapping exercise:**

*"Let's map this. Who were you when you started ministry 25 years ago? Who are you now? And who is trying to emerge—even if you can't see them clearly yet?"*

**As they explore, strong emotion surfaces when the pastor describes his younger self's certainty. The facilitator notices and transitions to MEMORY:**

*"There's grief here. You're not just losing a role—you're grieving a self that was more certain. Is there a story from that early time that you're still carrying?"*

**The pastor uncovers an inherited story from his father: "Ministry is the highest calling." He sees how this story has made any other path feel like failure. The work becomes about honoring what the story gave him while giving himself permission to author something new. He doesn't need to leave ministry—but he needs to choose it again, freely.**

# **PART FOUR: INTEGRATION**

## **Chapter 7: The Spiral Nature**

### **Spiral, Not Circle**

One of the most important concepts in this framework is the distinction between circles and spirals.

**Circle:**

* Same patterns repeating unconsciously

* "Why does this keep happening?"

* Shame and frustration

* No felt sense of progress

**Spiral:**

* Returning to familiar territory from a different altitude

* "I've been here before, and I'm different now"

* Curiosity about what this pass reveals

* Each return is an opportunity for deeper integration

| THE SPIRAL QUESTION When someone says "I thought I dealt with this already"—help them reframe. "You did deal with it. And now you're meeting it again from a different place. What can you see now that you couldn't see before?" |
| :---- |

### **BECOMING Returns to PRESENCE**

The seven threads form a spiral that returns to its beginning. After the work of BECOMING—the integration of who you were, who you are, and who you're becoming—you arrive back at PRESENCE. But you arrive transformed.

The person who shows up after authentic becoming is not the person who started the journey. They bring new capacity for presence, new understanding of consent, new relationship with their stories, new sense of timing, new embodiment, new comfort with uncertainty.

This is why the framework doesn't "end." Each passage through the threads prepares you for the next spiral—at a different altitude, with different questions, toward deeper integration.

## **Chapter 8: Special Considerations**

### **Trauma-Informed Practice**

This framework touches areas where trauma lives. Practice with care.

**Key principles:**

* The body is not always safe to enter. Go slower, give more control.

* "Can you feel that?" is sometimes answered "No" for protective reasons. Honor the protection.

* Don't push toward the threatening pole. Let them approach at their pace.

* Normalize protective responses: "It makes sense you'd collapse toward \[pole\]—that's how you survived."

* Know your limits. Refer when appropriate.

| THE SAFETY QUESTION Before any embodiment work, ask: "Is it safe enough to feel your body right now?" The question is not "can you feel?" but "is it safe to feel?" If not, work with what is accessible. |
| :---- |

### **Power Dynamics**

The threads can be weaponized. Be alert to power dynamics.

* CONSENT collapse: "You agreed to this" used to override ongoing consent

* PAUSE collapse: "Let's not rush" used by those with power to maintain status quo

* MEMORY collapse: Controlling the narrative about shared history

* UNCERTAINTY collapse: "We can't know" used to avoid accountability

Your role is to notice when threads are being used to consolidate power rather than hold creative tension. Name it gently but clearly.

### **When the Framework Doesn't Fit**

This framework is not for every situation.

**Don't use it when:**

* Someone is in active crisis requiring stabilization first

* Clear safety boundaries need to be set (not negotiated)

* The other party is acting in bad faith

* Professional clinical intervention is needed

* You're personally activated and can't hold the tension yourself

The framework requires good faith from participants and groundedness from the facilitator. Without these, use other tools.

## **Chapter 9: The Facilitator's Own Work**

### **Know Your Own Collapse Patterns**

You will be tempted to collapse. Know your patterns.

**Common facilitator collapses:**

* Rushing toward resolution (PAUSE collapse toward NOW)

* Over-identifying with one person's position (loss of PRESENCE)

* Intellectualizing to avoid the body's signals (EMBODIMENT collapse toward THINK)

* Needing to be the expert (UNCERTAINTY collapse toward SEEK)

* Imposing your own story onto their experience (MEMORY collapse)

Regular practice: After each session, ask yourself which poles you were drawn to collapse toward. What did that protect you from feeling?

### **Holding Your Own Tension**

The most powerful intervention is your own capacity to hold tension without collapsing. When you can stay present while others are activated, you create a field where transformation becomes possible.

**Practices that help:**

* Regular meditation or contemplative practice

* Supervision or peer consultation

* Your own therapy or spiritual direction

* Body practices: yoga, somatic work, movement

* Journaling to process what sessions activate in you

| THE META-QUESTION FOR FACILITATORS Before each session: "What tension am I avoiding in myself that might make me want to resolve this too quickly in others?" |
| :---- |

### **Trust the Process**

Finally, trust the process. You are not responsible for making transformation happen. You are responsible for creating conditions where it can happen. The tension itself is generative. Your job is to hold space and witness.

Sometimes nothing seems to emerge. That's okay. Seeds planted in one session may germinate later. Partial movement is real movement. Your witnessing matters even when you can't see the fruit.

The Threads of Becoming is not a technique to master but a way of seeing. With practice, you'll begin to sense the threads in every conversation, every conflict, every threshold moment. You'll recognize collapse earlier and return to tension more gracefully. You'll trust that something new can emerge from what looks like impasse.

This is the work. Welcome to it.

# **APPENDIX: Quick Reference**

## **The Seven Seeds**

| Thread | Seed Question | Core Tensions |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **PRESENCE** | *Who's there?* | Within ↔ Between, Here ↔ Elsewhere |
| **CONSENT** | *May I?* | Yes ↔ No, Self ↔ Other |
| **MEMORY** | *What happened?* | Given ↔ Chosen, Telling ↔ Told |
| **PAUSE** | *Why do we wait here?* | Not Yet ↔ Now, More ↔ Enough |
| **EMBODIMENT** | *How does my body know?* | Think ↔ Feel, Stay ↔ Go |
| **UNCERTAINTY** | *What is the mystery unveiling?* | Hide ↔ Seek, Threat ↔ Wonder |
| **BECOMING** | *Who am I now?* | Same ↔ Different, Return ↔ Forward |

## **Session Arc**

1. ARRIVE (2-5 min): Establish presence, listen for which thread is activated

2. NAME (3-10 min): Identify the thread, name the poles, use diagnostic questions

3. HOLD (5-30 min): Help them stay in tension, watch for collapse, support emergence

4. INTEGRATE (2-5 min): Name what emerged, identify next step, close with presence

## **Core Facilitation Moves**

* Validate both poles: "Neither of you is wrong"

* Name the collapse: "I notice you've landed firmly in \[pole\]"

* Introduce the missing pole: "And I wonder what \[other pole\] might offer"

* Return to tension: "What would it be like to hold both?"

* Trust emergence: "Something is trying to arise here"

## **Emergency Questions**

**When stuck:**

* "What's happening in your body right now?" (EMBODIMENT gateway)

* "Is there a story from before that's shaping this?" (MEMORY check)

* "Do you feel like you have a real choice here?" (CONSENT check)

* "Is the urgency from the situation or from inside you?" (PAUSE check)

**When activated yourself:**

* Breathe. Feel your feet.

* "Which pole am I wanting to collapse toward right now?"

* "What am I protecting myself from feeling?"

* "Can I hold this tension, or do I need to pause?"
