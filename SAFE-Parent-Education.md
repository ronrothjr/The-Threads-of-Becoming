# S.A.F.E. for Parents

**Educational Materials for Family Partnership**

---

## The Parent Problem in Bullying Dynamics

Parents are often the invisible force perpetuating bullying cycles, and most anti-bullying programs completely ignore this. **Parents can't teach their kids to be S.A.F.E. if they're not practicing it themselves.**

## How Parents Collapse

### Parents of Kids Being Hurt Often Collapse Into:

- **Rescue mode:** "I need to fix this for my child" (helicopter parenting)
- **Victim identity reinforcement:** "You're being bullied because you're special/different"
- **Blame the school:** "The teacher isn't doing enough"
- **Overprotection:** Removing the child from all difficult situations (no resilience building)

**Result:** The child learns they're helpless and need adults to solve their problems.

---

### Parents of Kids Doing Harm Often Collapse Into:

- **Denial:** "My kid would never do that"
- **Justification:** "Boys will be boys" / "She's just assertive"
- **Blame the victim:** "That other kid is too sensitive"
- **Punish at home, model aggression:** Yelling, shaming, grounding harshly

**Result:** The child learns to hide behavior and that power/control is how you handle problems.

---

### Parents of Witnesses Often Collapse Into:

- **Dismissal:** "Stay out of it, it's not your problem"
- **Fear:** "Don't get involved or you'll be next"
- **Moral superiority:** "I'm glad you're not like those kids"
- **Pressure to fix it:** "You should have stood up for them"

**Result:** The child learns either complicity ("not my problem") or guilt ("I failed to help").

## Parent Workshops

### Workshop 1: When Your Child Is Being Hurt (90 minutes)

**Session Structure:**

**Part 1: Recognizing Your Own Collapse (30 min)**
- Small group discussion: "What did your parents do when you were bullied?"
- Identify patterns: rescue, blame, minimize
- Self-reflection: "Where do I collapse when my child is hurting?"

**Part 2: Learning S.A.F.E. Together (30 min)**
- The four S.A.F.E. steps explained
- Why helping them SEE (not rescuing) builds capacity
- How to ASK about tension with your child ("What do you need?" vs. "I'll fix it")
- Holding the FEEL tension: They're hurt AND they have choices

**Part 3: Practice Scenarios (30 min)**
- Scenario 1: Child comes home crying, "No one played with me at recess"
  - **Collapse response:** "That's awful! I'm calling the school tomorrow."
  - **S.A.F.E. response:** "I see you're hurting. What did you notice? What do you need right now—to talk, to be held, to have space?"
- Scenario 2: Child reports being called names repeatedly
  - **Collapse response:** "You need to tell the teacher to make them stop."
  - **S.A.F.E. response:** "That's hard. Can you feel both—you want them to stop AND you can't control them? What do YOU want to choose about who you're becoming?"
- Scenario 3: Your child is being excluded by their friend group
  - **Collapse response:** "Those kids aren't good friends anyway. You're better than them."
  - **S.A.F.E. response:** "Let's SEE what's happening. What's the tension? You want to belong AND they get to choose their friends. Can both be true?"

**Takeaways:**
- One-page S.A.F.E. quick reference for home
- Three questions to ask daily: "What did you SEE today?" "What tensions are you feeling?" "Who do you want to be?"

### Workshop 2: When Your Child Is Doing Harm (90 minutes)

**Session Structure:**

**Part 1: Owning What's Hard (30 min)**
- The shame of hearing "your child is bullying"
- Common parental defenses (denial, blame, justify)
- The collapse: Punishing harshly to prove you're a "good parent"

**Part 2: S.A.F.E. for Repair, Not Punishment (30 min)**
- Punishment creates hiding; repair creates learning
- Using S.A.F.E. at home:
  - **SEE:** "What were you feeling right before you said that? What did you notice in your body?"
  - **ASK:** "What tension was alive for you? Did you want to feel powerful? Seen? Respected?"
  - **FEEL:** "You wanted that AND you hurt someone. Can both be true?"
  - **EMERGE:** "Who do you want to be? Someone who gets power by making others small, or someone who can feel strong differently?"

**Part 3: Practice Scenarios (30 min)**
- Scenario 1: Teacher calls—your child pushed another student
  - **Collapse response:** "You're grounded for a month. What were you thinking?"
  - **S.A.F.E. response:** "The teacher said you pushed Jordan. Let's figure out what happened. What did you SEE right before you pushed?"
- Scenario 2: You overhear your child saying mean things online
  - **Collapse response:** "Phone taken away. You're a bully."
  - **S.A.F.E. response:** "I saw what you wrote. That's not okay. But I want to understand—what were you feeling? What do you need that you're trying to get this way?"
- Scenario 3: Your child is excluding another kid repeatedly
  - **Collapse response:** "You will include them tomorrow or else."
  - **S.A.F.E. response:** "I notice you've been leaving Alex out. Can we talk about that? What's the tension? You want your special friends AND you know how it feels to be left out?"

**Takeaways:**
- Repair conversation template
- How to set consequences that teach (not just punish)
- Weekly check-in: "Who did you become this week? Who do you want to be next week?"

### Workshop 3: When Your Child Witnesses Harm (60 minutes)

**Session Structure:**

**Part 1: The Witness Dilemma (20 min)**
- Why witnesses stay silent (fear, social cost, uncertainty)
- The parent response that makes it worse: "You should have helped"
- The collapse: Guilt without capacity-building

**Part 2: S.A.F.E. for Witnesses (20 min)**
- Helping your child SEE without pressure: "What did you notice? What did you feel?"
- ASK about their tension: "Did you want to help AND feel scared? Both real?"
- FEEL both sides: "You care about them AND you're worried about yourself. Can both matter?"
- EMERGE: "What's one small thing you could do that feels possible? (Sit with them at lunch? Tell a teacher what you saw? Ask if they're okay?)"

**Part 3: Practice Scenarios (20 min)**
- Scenario 1: Child says, "Everyone was laughing at this kid but I didn't"
  - **Collapse response:** "Good, I'm glad you didn't join in."
  - **S.A.F.E. response:** "What was that like for you? Did you feel torn? What do you wish you'd done?"
- Scenario 2: Child says, "I saw my friend getting pushed but I was scared to say anything"
  - **Collapse response:** "You need to tell an adult when that happens!"
  - **S.A.F.E. response:** "That sounds scary. You wanted to help AND you felt scared. Both make sense. What feels like something you could do next time that wouldn't feel too big?"

**Takeaways:**
- Courage isn't the absence of fear—it's choosing who you want to be even when you're scared
- How to celebrate small acts of courage (not demand heroism)

## Take-Home Resources

### Resource 1: S.A.F.E. Quick Reference for Families

**When your child comes home upset:**

1. **SEE** - "What do you notice? What do you feel in your body?"
2. **ASK** - "What's the tension? What are you wanting/needing?"
3. **FEEL** - "Can both things be true? (You're hurt AND you have choices?)"
4. **EMERGE** - "Who do you want to be in this? What feels like you?"

**Remember:** You're not solving. You're holding space for them to find their own way.

---

### Resource 2: Family S.A.F.E. Journal

**Weekly Prompts (for dinner table or bedtime):**

- **Monday:** "What did you SEE this week that was hard?"
- **Tuesday:** "What tension are you feeling right now?" (school, friends, family)
- **Wednesday:** "Can you feel two things at once? (Example: You're excited for the sleepover AND nervous?)"
- **Thursday:** "Who do you want to become this week?"
- **Friday:** "What's one S.A.F.E. choice you made this week?"

---

### Resource 3: S.A.F.E. Conversation Starters

**Instead of "How was school?"**
- "What did you notice today?"
- "Any tensions you're holding?"
- "Who did you become today?"

**Instead of "Did anyone bully you?"**
- "Did you see anyone being left out or hurt today?"
- "Were there any hard moments you want to talk about?"
- "Did you have a chance to be S.A.F.E. today?"

**Instead of "What's wrong?"**
- "What are you feeling right now?"
- "What do you need?"
- "Do you want to talk, be held, or have space?"

Hi [Teacher],

## Assessment: Before & After

### Before S.A.F.E. Parent Education

- Parents react with collapse (rescue, blame, punish)
- Kids learn helplessness or hiding
- Parent-school communication is adversarial ("Fix this")
- Home and school use different language
- Incidents repeat because capacity isn't built

### After S.A.F.E. Parent Education

- Parents hold space for tension (don't solve, don't shame)
- Kids develop agency and internal capacity
- Parent-school communication is partnership ("How can we support together?")
- Home and school speak same language (Threads, S.A.F.E. steps)
- Incidents decrease because kids and parents have tools
