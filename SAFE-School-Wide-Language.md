# School-Wide S.A.F.E. Language

**From crossing guards to administrators—everyone speaks S.A.F.E.**

---

## The Power of Shared Language

S.A.F.E. isn't just a classroom program—it's the common language of your entire school community. When crossing guards, cafeteria staff, recess monitors, safety patrol, office staff, custodians, and administrators all speak the same language of tension-holding, students experience consistency, safety, and genuine community everywhere they go.

**When a crossing guard says "I see you holding the PAUSE thread right now" and a cafeteria worker says "Can you ASK what they're needing?" and a principal says "I FEEL the UNCERTAINTY thread here"—students know they're in a culture that understands them, not just a program that manages them.**
