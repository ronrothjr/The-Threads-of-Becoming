# SEE & ACT: Crisis Protocol

**When to intervene immediately—and when S.A.F.E. can wait**

---

## The Critical Distinction

**S.A.F.E. is powerful—but it's not for every moment.** When physical violence is happening NOW, when a child discloses abuse, when weapons are present, when self-harm is imminent—you don't facilitate tension-holding. You **SEE the crisis and ACT immediately**.

**Critical Distinction:** S.A.F.E. is for *conflict* (tension between people that can be held and explored). SEE & ACT is for *crisis* (immediate danger requiring adult intervention). Confusing the two can cause harm.

---

## The Decision Tree: Crisis or Conflict?

### 🚨 SEE & ACT (Crisis) - Immediate Adult Intervention Required

**Use When:**
- **Physical violence happening NOW** (hitting, kicking, choking, etc.)
- **Credible threat of imminent harm** ("I'm going to hurt you after school")
- **Weapon present or threatened**
- **Sexual harassment or assault** (touching, exposing, coercion)
- **Child abuse disclosure** ("My dad hit me last night")
- **Self-harm risk** ("I want to die," visible cutting, etc.)
- **Substance use on campus**
- **Severe emotional dysregulation** (student a danger to self/others)

**Action:** Intervene immediately. Ensure safety first. No S.A.F.E. facilitation yet.

---

### 🤝 S.A.F.E. (Conflict) - Tension-Holding Appropriate

**Use When:**
- **Exclusion** ("You can't play with us")
- **Unkind words** (name-calling, teasing, rumors)
- **Social conflict** (friendship breakups, group dynamics)
- **Disagreement over rules/games**
- **Hurt feelings** (someone was left out, ignored)
- **Boundary testing** (pushing limits, seeing what they can get away with)
- **Peer pressure situations** (choosing between groups)
- **Identity exploration** (trying on different roles, testing who they want to be)

**Action:** Facilitate S.A.F.E. process. Hold the tension. Help students learn.

## SEE & ACT Protocol (Step-by-Step)

### When Crisis Is Happening

#### STEP 1: SEE the Crisis
- **Immediate assessment:** Is someone in physical danger right now?
- **Trust your gut:** If it feels like a crisis, treat it as one
- **Don't deliberate:** You can debrief later—safety first

#### STEP 2: ACT to Ensure Safety
- **Stop the harm:** Physically separate if needed (verbal command first: "Stop. Separate now.")
- **Call for backup:** Radio/phone for admin, counselor, or security immediately
- **Secure the scene:** Remove other students if necessary, eliminate access to weapons/harm
- **Check for injuries:** Attend to physical harm, call nurse/911 if needed

#### STEP 3: Report & Document
- **Mandatory reporting:** Abuse disclosure, weapons, assault—follow legal protocols immediately
- **Incident report:** Document what you saw, heard, and did (facts, not interpretation)
- **Notify admin:** Principal/AP must be informed immediately
- **Contact parents:** Admin handles parent notification for crisis situations

#### STEP 4: Only THEN Consider S.A.F.E.
- **After safety is secured:** Once crisis is resolved, you may use S.A.F.E. for repair/learning
- **Not immediately:** Students in crisis can't engage in reflection—give space first
- **Counselor-led:** Crisis-to-S.A.F.E. transitions should involve trained counselor

## SEE & ACT Pocket Card (For All Staff)

### Laminated Card (3×5) Every Staff Member Carries

#### FRONT SIDE

**SEE & ACT: Crisis Protocol**
*When immediate danger is present*

**1. SEE the Crisis**
- Physical violence NOW?
- Weapon present?
- Abuse disclosure?
- Self-harm risk?
- Sexual harassment/assault?

**2. ACT Immediately**
- Stop the harm (separate, command)
- Call for backup (radio/phone)
- Secure safety (remove students, eliminate access)
- Check for injuries (nurse/911)

**3. Report**
- Mandatory reporting if required by law
- Incident report within 1 hour
- Notify admin immediately

#### BACK SIDE

**S.A.F.E.: Conflict Protocol**
*When tension can be held and explored*

**S - SEE**
"What do you notice happening?"

**A - ASK**
"Can you ask what they're feeling/needing?"

**F - FEEL**
"What do you feel? What do you need?"

**E - EMERGE**
"Who do you want to be in this moment?"

**Remember:** If you're unsure whether it's crisis or conflict, choose SEE & ACT. You can always transition to S.A.F.E. after safety is secured.

## Training Scenarios: Crisis vs. Conflict

*Staff training includes practicing these distinctions. Below are 12 scenarios staff discuss in groups: Crisis (SEE & ACT) or Conflict (S.A.F.E.)?*

### Scenario 1
**Situation:** Two students are shoving each other on the playground. No punches thrown yet, but they're escalating.

**Answer:** **CRISIS (SEE & ACT)**

**Why:** Physical aggression in progress—intervene before it escalates to violence. Separate immediately, then debrief with S.A.F.E. later.

---

### Scenario 2
**Situation:** A student comes to you crying because their friend said "I don't want to be your friend anymore."

**Answer:** **CONFLICT (S.A.F.E.)**

**Why:** Hurt feelings, friendship conflict—perfect for S.A.F.E. facilitation. No immediate danger.

---

### Scenario 3
**Situation:** A student whispers to you, "My uncle touched me in a bad way last night."

**Answer:** **CRISIS (SEE & ACT)**

**Why:** Mandatory reporting. Abuse disclosure requires immediate action—notify admin, follow legal protocols. No S.A.F.E. facilitation for abuse situations.

---

### Scenario 4
**Situation:** You overhear a group of girls saying mean things about another girl who isn't present.

**Answer:** **CONFLICT (S.A.F.E.)**

**Why:** Relational aggression, rumors—use S.A.F.E. to address. "I SEE something happening here. Can we talk about it?"

---

### Scenario 5
**Situation:** A student shows you cuts on their arm and says, "I did this last night because I hate myself."

**Answer:** **CRISIS (SEE & ACT)**

**Why:** Self-harm disclosure—immediate counselor/admin notification, parent contact, safety plan. S.A.F.E. may be part of long-term support, but crisis protocol first.

---

### Scenario 6
**Situation:** A student refuses to work with their assigned partner, saying "They're annoying and I don't want to."

**Answer:** **CONFLICT (S.A.F.E.)**

**Why:** Boundary/consent tension—perfect Thread work. "I FEEL the CONSENT thread here—you get to choose, and so do they. How do we hold that tension?"

---

### Scenario 7
**Situation:** You see a student pull a pocket knife out of their backpack during lunch.

**Answer:** **CRISIS (SEE & ACT)**

**Why:** Weapon on campus—immediate intervention. Secure the weapon, ensure safety, notify admin immediately.

---

### Scenario 8
**Situation:** Two students are arguing loudly about who gets to use the basketball first.

**Answer:** **CONFLICT (S.A.F.E.)**

**Why:** Disagreement over resources—classic S.A.F.E. moment. "I SEE both of you want the ball. What's needed here?"

---

### Scenario 9
**Situation:** A student says to you, "Marcus said he's going to beat me up after school today."

**Answer:** **CRISIS (SEE & ACT)**

**Why:** Credible threat of harm—investigate immediately, separate students, notify admin, ensure supervised dismissal. S.A.F.E. debrief only after safety secured.

---

### Scenario 10
**Situation:** You notice a student sitting alone at lunch every day for a week, looking sad.

**Answer:** **CONFLICT (S.A.F.E.)**

**Why:** Social exclusion pattern—check in using S.A.F.E. "I SEE you've been sitting alone. What's that like for you?" May also refer to counselor for deeper support.

---

### Scenario 11
**Situation:** A student is having a meltdown, throwing chairs, screaming, and won't respond to verbal de-escalation.

**Answer:** **CRISIS (SEE & ACT)**

**Why:** Severe dysregulation, danger to self/others—clear room, call admin/counselor, ensure safety. Once calm, you can explore what happened using S.A.F.E.

---

### Scenario 12
**Situation:** A student tells you another student touched their private parts during recess.

**Answer:** **CRISIS (SEE & ACT)**

**Why:** Sexual harassment/assault disclosure—mandatory reporting, immediate admin notification, parent contact, possible law enforcement. This is never a S.A.F.E. facilitation situation.

---

## When S.A.F.E. Can Wait (Or Shouldn't Happen)

### Situations Where S.A.F.E. Is Not Appropriate

#### 1. Trauma Responses
Student in trauma response (fight/flight/freeze) cannot engage in reflection or tension-holding. They need:
- **Safety and calm first:** Quiet space, trusted adult, regulation support
- **Time:** May be hours or days before S.A.F.E. conversation is possible
- **Counselor support:** Trained professional should lead when ready

**What NOT to do:** "Let's use S.A.F.E. to talk about this right now" when student is in crisis. You're adding cognitive load they can't handle.

---

#### 2. Power Imbalances (Abuse, Assault)
S.A.F.E. is for *peer conflict*, not *harm by those with power*. Never use S.A.F.E. for:
- **Adult-to-child abuse:** This is criminal, not conflict
- **Sexual assault:** This is violence, not tension to hold
- **Severe bullying with power differential:** When one student has systematic power over another (size, age, social status), S.A.F.E. can re-traumatize the victim

**What to do instead:** SEE & ACT protocol, counselor-led safety planning, restorative justice circles (if appropriate and victim consents).

---

#### 3. Special Populations in Crisis
Students with certain needs may not be able to engage S.A.F.E. in the moment:
- **Autism (sensory overload):** Need quiet, predictable environment before any conversation
- **ADHD (emotional flooding):** Need movement, time to regulate before processing
- **Anxiety (panic state):** Need grounding, breathing, safety before reflection

**Adaptation:** "I SEE you're overwhelmed right now. Let's find a safe spot and we can talk when you're ready." S.A.F.E. happens later, in adapted form.

---

#### 4. Legal/Disciplinary Consequences Required
Some behaviors have non-negotiable consequences (suspension, expulsion, law enforcement):
- Weapons on campus
- Drug distribution
- Assault causing injury

S.A.F.E. doesn't replace consequences—it can supplement them (restorative conversation after suspension, for example), but safety and accountability come first.

---

## Warning Signs: When S.A.F.E. Becomes Harmful

### Red Flags Staff Must Watch For

#### 1. Forcing S.A.F.E. When Student Says "I'm Not Ready"
**What it looks like:** Teacher insists on S.A.F.E. circle immediately after incident, student resists, teacher pushes anyway

**Why it's harmful:** Violates CONSENT thread—we don't force vulnerability

**What to do instead:** "I hear you're not ready. When would feel better? This afternoon? Tomorrow?"

---

#### 2. Using S.A.F.E. to Avoid Necessary Discipline
**What it looks like:** Student punches another student, teacher facilitates S.A.F.E. conversation but doesn't report incident or impose consequences

**Why it's harmful:** Minimizes harm, enables aggressor, teaches victim their safety doesn't matter

**What to do instead:** SEE & ACT first (report, consequences), S.A.F.E. as part of repair process after

---

#### 3. Asking Victim to "Understand" Aggressor's Perspective Too Soon
**What it looks like:** "I know they said something hurtful, but can you SEE why they might have been upset?"

**Why it's harmful:** Centers aggressor's feelings over victim's harm, can feel like gaslighting

**What to do instead:** Hold space for victim's feelings first. Separate conversations if needed. Repair happens when victim is ready, not on adult timeline.

---

#### 4. Public S.A.F.E. Processing of Private Harm
**What it looks like:** Teacher facilitates S.A.F.E. conversation about sexual harassment in front of whole class

**Why it's harmful:** Re-traumatizes victim, violates privacy, creates unsafe environment

**What to do instead:** Private conversations with counselor, parents notified, admin involved. Class-level education about consent/boundaries without naming individuals.

---

#### 5. Staff Using S.A.F.E. Without Adequate Training
**What it looks like:** Staff member skims S.A.F.E. overview, tries to facilitate complex conflict without understanding Threads framework

**Why it's harmful:** Can collapse tension prematurely, re-traumatize students, or escalate conflict

**What to do instead:** Require full training (6 hours minimum) before staff facilitate S.A.F.E. independently. Consult counselor for complex situations.
