# HOLD Integration Protocol: From Assessment to Daily Practice

## Overview

The Threads assessment tells you WHERE you collapse. HOLD is the universal practice for WHEN you collapse. This protocol connects them—using your assessment results to customize your HOLD practice for maximum development.

**The Core Principle:**
Assessment without practice is just interesting information.
Practice without assessment is unfocused effort.
Assessment + targeted practice = developmental transformation.

## How Assessment Informs HOLD Practice

### The HOLD Steps (Review)

**H - HALT:** Stop before you react. One breath. Create the gap.

**O - OBSERVE:** Check your body. What's happening physically?

**L - LOOK for the tension:** What two things feel like they can't both be true?

**D - DECIDE:** Who do you want to be in this moment?

### Which Step Addresses Which Thread

| HOLD Step | Primary Thread(s) Developed |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **HALT** | PAUSE — creates the gap |
| **OBSERVE** | EMBODIMENT — reconnects to body |
| **LOOK** | CONSENT, THRESHOLD, MEMORY, UNCERTAINTY — surfaces tensions |
| **DECIDE** | BECOMING, CONSENT — identity and choice |

### Customizing Based on Your Profile

Your lowest-capacity Threads determine your HOLD focus:

| If Your Weakest Thread Is... | Your HOLD Emphasis |
|------------------------------|-------------------|
| PAUSE | Extend the H step; practice longer pauses |
| EMBODIMENT | Deepen the O step; detailed body scans |
| CONSENT | Focus L step on connection vs. rightness tensions |
| THRESHOLD | Focus L step on discomfort-related tensions |
| MEMORY | Focus L step on inherited vs. chosen tensions |
| UNCERTAINTY | Focus L step on knowing vs. not-knowing tensions |
| BECOMING | Emphasize D step; clarify identity questions |

## The Daily Practice Protocol

### Level 1: Minimum Viable Practice (5 minutes/day)

**Morning Intention (2 minutes)**

Based on your assessment, set a daily intention:

*For PAUSE weakness:*
> "Today I will create one breath of space before responding to anything that triggers me."

*For EMBODIMENT weakness:*
> "Today I will check in with my body three times: morning, midday, and before bed."

*For CONSENT weakness:*
> "Today I will allow one person to be wrong without trying to change their mind."

*For THRESHOLD weakness:*
> "Today I will stay present with one uncomfortable moment without escaping or attacking."

*For MEMORY weakness:*
> "Today I will notice one inherited belief that's shaping my reaction."

*For UNCERTAINTY weakness:*
> "Today I will say 'I don't know' or 'I might be wrong' once, genuinely."

*For BECOMING weakness:*
> "Today I will ask 'Who do I want to become?' at least once when triggered."

**Evening Reflection (3 minutes)**

Answer these questions:

1. Did I encounter a situation that challenged my weakest Thread? What happened?
2. Did I practice HOLD? Which step was hardest?
3. What do I want to try differently tomorrow?

**Log Format:**
```
Date: ___________
Intention: ___________________________________
Trigger encountered? Y / N
HOLD practiced? Y / N
Step that was hardest: H / O / L / D
Brief note: __________________________________
```

---

### Level 2: Active Practice (15 minutes/day)

**Morning (5 minutes)**
- Set daily intention (per Level 1)
- Do a brief body scan (OBSERVE practice)
- Identify likely triggers for the day ahead

**Midday Check-in (5 minutes)**
- Body scan: What am I carrying?
- Have I been triggered yet today?
- If yes: Did I HOLD? What happened?
- Reset intention for afternoon

**Evening Reflection (5 minutes)**
- Full review of the day
- Identify patterns across multiple days
- Adjust tomorrow's intention based on what you learned
- Celebrate any progress, however small

**Weekly Review (15-20 minutes, once per week)**
- Review daily logs from the week
- Notice patterns: What triggered you most? Which HOLD step was consistently hardest?
- Adjust focus for next week
- Consider: Am I seeing any development in my weak Thread?

---

### Level 3: Deep Practice (30+ minutes/day)

**Morning Practice (15 minutes)**

*Body foundation (5 minutes):*
- Full body scan
- Notice current emotional state
- Locate emotions in body

*Intention setting (5 minutes):*
- Review your assessment profile
- Set Thread-specific intention
- Visualize successfully HOLDing a challenging moment

*Anticipatory practice (5 minutes):*
- What triggers are likely today?
- Mentally rehearse HOLD for each
- Feel the sequence: H → O → L → D

**Throughout the Day**

*Real-time practice:*
- When triggered, practice full HOLD sequence
- Note which step was most difficult
- If you skipped HOLD entirely, note that without judgment

*Micro-check-ins (30 seconds, multiple times):*
- What's happening in my body right now?
- Am I in a collapsed state?
- What Thread is at play?

**Evening Practice (15 minutes)**

*Detailed review (10 minutes):*
- Walk through each significant moment of the day
- For each trigger: What happened? Did you HOLD? What collapsed?
- For each HOLD success: What worked? How did it feel?

*Thread development journaling (5 minutes):*

Choose one of these prompts based on your weakest Thread:

**PAUSE prompts:**
- What would have been different if I'd waited 30 more seconds?
- What's my typical time-to-react? Can I extend it by 10%?
- What helps me create the gap?

**EMBODIMENT prompts:**
- What did my body know that my mind missed?
- Where do I hold tension when triggered?
- What happens when I bring attention to my body during conflict?

**CONSENT prompts:**
- Who am I trying to change? What would letting go feel like?
- What's the difference between sharing my truth and forcing it on others?
- Can I be right AND let them be different?

**THRESHOLD prompts:**
- What discomfort am I avoiding? What would staying with it teach me?
- Do I typically flee or attack? What's the cost of my pattern?
- What would one degree more tolerance feel like?

**MEMORY prompts:**
- Whose voice was I hearing in my reaction today?
- What story am I telling about "them"? Where did I learn it?
- What from my inheritance serves me? What doesn't?

**UNCERTAINTY prompts:**
- Where am I pretending to know more than I do?
- What question could I hold rather than forcing an answer?
- What would genuine curiosity look like here?

**BECOMING prompts:**
- Who did I become in that moment? Is that who I want to be?
- How is my identity showing up in my positions?
- What would I need to release to grow?

## Troubleshooting Common Challenges

### "I forget to practice"

**Solutions:**
- Set phone alarms for morning intention and evening reflection
- Pair HOLD with existing habits (coffee, commute, before meals)
- Put physical reminders in trigger-prone locations
- Use a practice partner for mutual accountability

### "I can't pause—it happens too fast"

**Solutions:**
- Start with very low-stakes situations
- Practice HOLD when NOT triggered to build the muscle
- Focus on extending the pause by even 1 second—any gap is progress
- Use body sensations as early warning (catch it sooner)

### "I don't know what I'm feeling in my body"

**Solutions:**
- Practice body scans outside of triggering situations
- Start with physical temperature: warm? cool? neither?
- Use touch as anchor: feel your feet on floor, hands in lap
- Name sensation before emotion: "tight" before "angry"

### "The L step is confusing"

**Solutions:**
- Use the formula: "I want _____ AND I want _____"
- Common tensions by Thread:
  - CONSENT: right AND connected
  - THRESHOLD: safe AND present
  - MEMORY: loyal AND free
  - UNCERTAINTY: certain AND open
- If stuck, default to "I want to react AND I want to respond wisely"

### "I know what to do but I still collapse"

**Solutions:**
- This is normal—knowing is not doing
- Reduce expectations: catch collapse 10% more often as a goal
- Focus on catching collapse SOONER, not preventing it entirely
- Practice self-compassion: noticing collapse after is still progress

### "My progress isn't linear"

**Solutions:**
- Development is never linear—expect waves
- New contexts may reveal old collapses
- Stress reduces capacity temporarily
- Compare to months ago, not yesterday

## Integration with Extended Assessment

### Using the Extended Assessment for Deeper Practice

The Extended Assessment provides:
- **Collapse direction** — Different practice for Collapse A vs. Collapse B
- **Context sensitivity** — Know where to focus practice
- **Awareness level** — Adjust practice intensity

### Direction-Specific Practice

**If you collapse toward Pole A (e.g., impulsive, forcing, aggressive):**
- Emphasize HALT—create the gap
- Practice slowing down, waiting, not-doing
- Ask "What if I didn't respond?"

**If you collapse toward Pole B (e.g., frozen, withdrawn, paralyzed):**
- Emphasize DECIDE—create movement
- Practice small actions despite uncertainty
- Ask "What's the smallest step I could take?"

### Context-Specific Focus

If your assessment shows you collapse most in:

**Family:** Practice HOLD before family gatherings. Set explicit intentions. Debrief afterward.

**Work:** Use meetings as practice opportunities. Set intention before each meeting.

**Online:** Build in structural delays (draft, wait, review). Log off when triggered.

**Political conversations:** Consider whether to engage at all. If yes, HOLD intensively.

---

## Practice Community Options

### Practice Partners

Find someone who:
- Also practices HOLD
- Has complementary (not identical) collapse patterns
- Can offer honest reflection without judgment
- Is committed to mutual accountability

**Partnership format:**
- Share daily intentions and reflections
- Weekly 20-minute check-in call
- Share wins and struggles
- Offer observations about each other's patterns

### Practice Circles

Small groups (4-8) who:
- Meet weekly or biweekly
- Share practice experiences
- Work through challenges together
- Celebrate development

**Circle format:**
- Opening: Brief body check-in
- Sharing: Each person shares one HOLD moment (or missed moment)
- Reflection: Others offer observations
- Closing: Set intentions for next period

### Facilitated Development

For serious practitioners:
- One-on-one work with trained facilitator
- Extended assessment with interpretation
- Customized practice protocol
- Regular check-ins and adjustment
- Deeper Thread work beyond HOLD
