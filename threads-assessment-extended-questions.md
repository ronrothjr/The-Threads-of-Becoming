# Threads Capacity Assessment: Extended Questions Bank

## Overview

This document contains the full question bank for the Extended Threads Capacity Assessment. While the Quick Profile provides a snapshot, the Extended Assessment offers:

- **Collapse direction identification** — Which pole do you collapse toward?
- **Context-specific measurement** — Where does collapse happen most?
- **Deeper pattern recognition** — Nuanced understanding of your collapse dynamics
- **More reliable scoring** — 7-10 questions per Thread for greater accuracy

**Estimated completion time:** 20-25 minutes

---

## Assessment Structure

For each Thread, questions address:

1. **General collapse tendency** — How often/easily do you collapse this Thread?
2. **Collapse direction** — Which pole do you collapse toward?
3. **Context sensitivity** — Which situations trigger collapse?
4. **Awareness level** — Do you notice when you're collapsing?

## Scoring and Interpretation

### Full Scoring Guide

For each Thread (10 questions):

**(a) = 1 point** — Strong collapse tendency
**(b) = 2 points** — Moderate collapse tendency
**(c) = 3 points** — Some capacity; collapse under pressure
**(d) = 4 points** — Strong capacity; rare collapse

**Thread Score Range: 10-40**

| Score | Capacity Level | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| 34-40 | Very High | Consistent capacity; collapse rare |
| 27-33 | High | Strong capacity; collapse under extreme pressure |
| 20-26 | Moderate | Variable capacity; collapses under stress |
| 13-19 | Low | Frequent collapse; development priority |
| 10-12 | Very Low | Consistent collapse; urgent development needed |

### Collapse Direction Identification

Questions 4, 5, 6 in each section identify your collapse direction.

If mostly (a) responses: **Collapse A direction**
If mostly (b) responses: **Collapse B direction**
If mixed: **Bidirectional collapse** (different triggers, different directions)

### Context Pattern Identification

Questions 7, 8, 9 in each section identify context sensitivity.

Note which contexts show lowest capacity—these are your collapse triggers.

Common patterns:
- **Family collapse**: High capacity elsewhere, low with family
- **Online collapse**: Reasonable in person, reactive online
- **Political collapse**: General capacity, but politics triggers you

### Awareness Level

Question 10 in each section identifies your awareness.

(a) = Unaware (collapse feels like reality)
(b) = Retrospective awareness
(c) = In-the-moment awareness
(d) = Anticipatory awareness

Higher awareness = faster development, because you can catch collapse sooner.

## Using Extended Results

### For Individual Development

1. **Focus on lowest 1-2 Threads** — Building capacity here has highest impact
2. **Know your collapse direction** — Practice shifts based on which pole you collapse toward
3. **Target your weakest context** — Practice HOLD specifically in this environment
4. **Use awareness level as leverage** — Build real-time awareness to catch collapse sooner

### For Facilitators

1. **Design interventions for specific Thread weaknesses**
2. **Adjust language based on collapse direction** (different medicine for different poles)
3. **Sequence development** (PAUSE and EMBODIMENT often enable other Threads)
4. **Track progress** with periodic re-assessment

### For Groups/Organizations

1. **Aggregate profiles** to identify collective collapse patterns
