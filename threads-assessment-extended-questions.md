# Threads Capacity Assessment: Extended Questions Bank

## Overview

This document contains the full question bank for the Extended Threads Capacity Assessment. While the Quick Profile provides a snapshot, the Extended Assessment offers:

- **Collapse direction identification** — Which pole do you collapse toward?
- **Context-specific measurement** — Where does collapse happen most?
- **Deeper pattern recognition** — Nuanced understanding of your collapse dynamics
- **More reliable scoring** — 10 questions per Thread for greater accuracy

**Estimated completion time:** 25-30 minutes

## Assessment Structure

For each Thread, questions address:

1. **General collapse tendency** — How often/easily do you collapse this Thread?
2. **Collapse direction** — Which pole do you collapse toward?
3. **Context sensitivity** — Which situations trigger collapse?
4. **Awareness level** — Do you notice when you're collapsing?

## PRESENCE: Locating Yourself in Relationship

### Collapse Directions
- **Collapse A (Isolation):** Complete withdrawal into "Within"; can't access "Between"; solitary to the point of disconnection
- **Collapse B (Enmeshment):** Lost in "Between"; can't access "Within"; no internal anchor; need others constantly

**The Thread:** Where am I...? The capacity to hold both Within and Between, Here and Elsewhere. When held: sovereignty AND connection. When collapsed: either isolated or enmeshed.

**Shadows:** Intrusion (violating the boundary between) / Abandonment (severing connection entirely)

### General Tendency Questions

**PR1. Internal Anchor**
> When you're alone with no external demands, how do you feel?

- (a) Lost or anxious—I need others or external structure to feel grounded
- (b) Somewhat uncomfortable—I can manage but prefer company or activity

- (d) Very clear—I know my own experience while being with others

### Collapse Direction Questions

**PR4. Which Pattern Fits You Better?**
> When you're struggling with presence, which is more true?

- (a) I withdraw completely—can't access connection, isolated in my own world
- (b) I lose myself in others—no internal anchor, need others to feel real
- (c) Both happen depending on the situation

- (c) Sometimes isolate, sometimes cling
- (d) I can reach out for support while maintaining my own ground

**PR6. The Preference Pattern**
> Which feels more comfortable as a default state?

- (c) About the same as face-to-face
- (d) Actually easier—digital space helps me maintain boundaries

### Awareness Questions

**PR10. Presence Collapse Recognition**
> When you've collapsed into isolation or enmeshment, when do you notice?

- (a) I don't recognize it—isolation feels like protection, enmeshment feels like love

- (a) My patterns feel like just how I am, or my growth feels real
- (b) Later I sometimes recognize I was stuck or bypassing
- (c) I can often catch myself in regression or bypass

## Scoring and Interpretation

### Full Scoring Guide

For each Thread (10 questions):

**(a) = 1 point** — Strong collapse tendency
**(b) = 2 points** — Moderate collapse tendency
**(c) = 3 points** — Some capacity; collapse under pressure
**(d) = 4 points** — Strong capacity; rare collapse

**Thread Score Range: 10-40**

| Score | Capacity Level | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| 34-40 | Very High | Consistent capacity; collapse rare |
| 27-33 | High | Strong capacity; collapse under extreme pressure |
| 20-26 | Moderate | Variable capacity; collapses under stress |
| 13-19 | Low | Frequent collapse; development priority |
| 10-12 | Very Low | Consistent collapse; urgent development needed |

### Collapse Direction Identification

Questions 4, 5, 6 in each section identify your collapse direction.

If mostly (a) responses: **Collapse A direction**
If mostly (b) responses: **Collapse B direction**
If mixed: **Bidirectional collapse** (different triggers, different directions)

### Context Pattern Identification

Questions 7, 8, 9 in each section identify context sensitivity.

Note which contexts show lowest capacity—these are your collapse triggers.

Common patterns:
- **Family collapse**: High capacity elsewhere, low with family
- **Online collapse**: Reasonable in person, reactive online
- **Political collapse**: General capacity, but politics triggers you

### Awareness Level

Question 10 in each section identifies your awareness.

(a) = Unaware (collapse feels like reality)
(b) = Retrospective awareness
(c) = In-the-moment awareness
(d) = Anticipatory awareness

Higher awareness = faster development, because you can catch collapse sooner.

## SEE/HOLD/EMERGE Framework

The seven Threads organize into three functional groups:

### SEE (Orienting - Threads 1-4)

**Threads:** PRESENCE, CONSENT, MEMORY, PAUSE

These are the orienting capacities—locating yourself, allowing others, holding history, creating pause. Together they form the capacity to SEE clearly where you are and what is happening.

**To Calculate SEE Average:**
Add scores for PRESENCE + CONSENT + MEMORY + PAUSE, divide by 4

**SEE Interpretation:**

| Average | Level | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|
| 30-40 | Very High | Strong orientation; you can see clearly even under pressure |
| 23-29 | High | Good orientation; some collapse in extreme situations |
| 16-22 | Moderate | Variable orientation; stress disrupts your seeing |
| 10-15 | Low | Frequent disorientation; difficulty seeing clearly what's happening |

### HOLD (Sourcing - Threads 5-6)

**Threads:** EMBODIMENT, UNCERTAINTY

These are the sourcing capacities—staying connected to body wisdom and remaining curious in not-knowing. Together they form the capacity to HOLD complexity and remain resourced.

**To Calculate HOLD Average:**
Add scores for EMBODIMENT + UNCERTAINTY, divide by 2

**HOLD Interpretation:**

| Average | Level | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|
| 30-40 | Very High | Strong holding; you stay resourced and curious |
| 23-29 | High | Good holding; can source from body and uncertainty |
| 16-22 | Moderate | Variable holding; stress disconnects you from resources |
| 10-15 | Low | Difficult to hold; disconnected from body and curiosity |

### EMERGE (Integrating - Thread 7)

**Thread:** BECOMING

This is the integrating capacity—allowing genuine transformation through the spiral path of Different + Return. The capacity to change while maintaining continuity, to grow without bypassing.

**EMERGE Interpretation:**

| Score | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 34-40 | Very High | Genuine transformation; spiral development |
| 27-33 | High | Real growth; mostly avoiding regression and bypass |
| 20-26 | Moderate | Some transformation, some stuck patterns or bypassing |
| 13-19 | Low | Frequent regression or bypass; difficulty with real change |
| 10-12 | Very Low | Stuck in loops or performing growth without embodiment |

### Integration Patterns

**Pattern 1: Capacity Without Integration**
- SEE/HOLD: High
- EMERGE: Low
- **Meaning:** You can see clearly and stay resourced, but fear prevents transformation. You have the capacity but won't use it for real change.

**Pattern 2: Bypass Pattern**
- SEE/HOLD: Low
- EMERGE: High
- **Meaning:** You're changing without proper foundation—spiritual or intellectual bypassing. You appear to transform but lack the embodiment and orientation to make it real.

**Pattern 3: Developing Foundation**
- SEE: Moderate to High
- HOLD: Low
- EMERGE: Any
- **Meaning:** You can orient but struggle to stay resourced. Build EMBODIMENT and UNCERTAINTY before focusing on BECOMING.

**Pattern 4: Integrated Development**
- SEE: Moderate to High
- HOLD: Moderate to High
- EMERGE: Moderate to High
- **Meaning:** Balanced development across all capacities. Continue spiral development.

## Using Extended Results

### For Individual Development

1. **Focus on lowest 1-2 Threads** — Building capacity here has highest impact
2. **Know your collapse direction** — Practice shifts based on which pole you collapse toward
3. **Target your weakest context** — Practice HOLD specifically in this environment
4. **Use awareness level as leverage** — Build real-time awareness to catch collapse sooner
5. **Check SEE/HOLD/EMERGE balance** — Identify if you need foundation building or integration work

### For Facilitators

1. **Design interventions for specific Thread weaknesses**
2. **Adjust language based on collapse direction** (different medicine for different poles)
3. **Sequence development** (SEE and HOLD capacities often enable EMERGE)
4. **Track progress** with periodic re-assessment
5. **Identify bypass patterns** (high EMERGE with low SEE/HOLD signals spiritual/intellectual bypassing)

### For Groups/Organizations

1. **Aggregate profiles** to identify collective collapse patterns
2. **Design team practices** based on shared weaknesses
3. **Create balanced teams** with complementary Thread strengths
4. **Measure culture change** through group capacity development
5. **Build collective SEE/HOLD capacity** before organizational transformation initiatives
