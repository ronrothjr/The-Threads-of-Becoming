# **The Spiral of Becoming 2.0?**

# **A Deep Critique of The Spiral of Becoming**

## **1\. The Humanist Challenge**

**"Why do we need another metaphysical framework?"** Religious humanists spent decades freeing UU from required theological structures. The Spiral, despite its openness, still imposes a PARTICULAR way of seeing reality \- through tensions, threads, and becoming. This could be seen as regression from the hard-won freedom to "believe what you want as long as you act ethically."

**The Process Theology grounding is problematic.** Most UU humanists reject Process Theology's quasi-theistic elements. Even if you say "God is optional," the entire framework emerges from Whiteheadian metaphysics that many find unnecessarily complex and ultimately unprovable. Why not just use psychological and sociological frameworks that don't require metaphysical commitments?

> ### **Process Thought Reduced to Essentials**
> 
> Strip away Whitehead's metaphysics and keep just these observable principles:
> 
> 1. **Everything changes** \- Nothing is permanently fixed (verified by physics, biology, psychology)  
> 2. **Past influences but doesn't determine** \- We're shaped by history but not imprisoned by it  
> 3. **Relationships constitute reality** \- Nothing exists in isolation (ecology, systems theory)  
> 4. **Transformation happens through invitation, not force** \- Coercion creates resistance, not change (verified by psychology, conflict resolution research)  
>    No God required. No metaphysics needed. Just observable patterns of how change happens.

**Where's the empirical basis?** You cite no psychological studies, neuroscience research, or sociological data. For humanists who ground their religion in reason and science, this feels like another "invented system" rather than evidence-based practice.

> ### **Empirical Basis for The Spiral**
> 
> The framework maps directly onto established research:
> 
> **Tension as generative:**
> 
> * Cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957\) \- tension drives change  
> * Dialectical Behavior Therapy (Linehan) \- holding opposites reduces suffering  
> * Polarity Management (Barry Johnson) \- organizations thrive by managing not solving tensions  
> * Post-traumatic growth research \- suffering plus support creates transformation  
>   **Specific threads validated by research:**  
> * **PRESENCE**: Mindfulness research (Kabat-Zinn, Davidson) shows measurable benefits  
> * **CONSENT**: Self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan) \- autonomy essential for wellbeing  
> * **MEMORY**: Narrative therapy research \- reframing stories changes outcomes  
> * **PAUSE**: Response flexibility research \- gap between stimulus/response is where choice lives  
> * **EMBODIMENT**: Somatic trauma research (van der Kolk, Levine) \- body holds truth  
> * **UNCERTAINTY**: Tolerance for ambiguity correlates with creativity and reduced prejudice  
> * **BECOMING**: Neuroplasticity research \- brains literally rebuild continuously

## **2\. The Liberation Theology Critique**

From Black, Indigenous, and other liberation perspectives:

**Where is POWER as a thread?** The Spiral names universal tensions but conspicuously absent is the tension between oppressor and oppressed, privileged and marginalized. This isn't universal in the same way as "presence" \- it's specifically about systemic injustice. By not naming it, the framework risks being another privileged person's luxury meditation.

> **POWER** **Seed:** "Who shapes reality?"
> 
> **The Tension:** Agency vs. Structure
> 
> **Universal Questions:**
> 
> * Who decides what's possible and what's not?  
> * When is power generative and when is it oppressive?  
> * How do we redistribute power without reproducing domination?  
> * What's the relationship between personal and systemic power?  
> * When do we resist and when do we build alternatives?  
>   This isn't just "another thread" but perhaps the **meta-thread** that affects all others:  
> * CONSENT: Who has real choice vs. illusion of choice?  
> * MEMORY: Whose stories get preserved?  
> * BECOMING: Who gets to transform vs. who must survive?

**The framework feels individualistic.** Despite claims of community application, the threads focus on personal experience: "Do we choose?" "Who are we?" Where are the explicitly collective threads: "Who decides?" "Who benefits?" "Whose story gets told?"

> ### **The Spiral 2.0 Architecture**
> 
> With these additions, The Spiral becomes:
> 
> **Personal Threads:** PRESENCE, CONSENT, MEMORY, PAUSE 
> 
> **Collective Threads:** POWER, WITNESS, EMBODIMENT 
> 
> **Transformative Thread:** BECOMING (bridging personal/collective)
> 
> This addresses the individualism critique while maintaining personal practice.

**Process without justice is privileged abstraction.** The ability to sit with "creative tension" rather than demanding resolution is itself a privilege. When your child is hungry, when police brutality threatens your life, when systems actively oppress you \- you need RESOLUTION, not creative tension.

> ### **PAUSE as Revolutionary Act**
> 
> PAUSE isn't privileged inaction. In a system demanding instant reaction, instant consumption, instant submission \- PAUSE is resistance.
> 
> "When do we act?" includes:
> 
> * When is waiting strategic and when is it complicity?  
> * How long do we prepare before confronting injustice?  
> * When does patience become enabling?  
>   Historical evidence: Every successful movement had PAUSE:  
> * Montgomery Bus Boycott: Months of planning before action  
> * Gandhi's movements: Extensive preparation, training, discipline  
> * ACT UP: Strategic timing for maximum impact  
>   PAUSE is the space where oppressed people have always planned revolution. It's not "whether" but "when" and "how."

**Cultural appropriation concerns.** The framework draws from multiple traditions without deep engagement with any. Adding "Indigenous elders can teach about memory" doesn't excuse extracting concepts without relationship, accountability, or reciprocity.

## **3\. The Christian Perspective**

**Where is the prophetic tradition?** Liberal Christianity has always emphasized the prophetic \- speaking truth to power, demanding justice, afflicting the comfortable. The Spiral seems to comfort everyone equally without challenging anyone specifically.

> ### **The Prophetic Thread: WITNESS**
> 
> **WITNESS** (new) **Seed:** "What must be named?"
> 
> **The Tension:** Comfort vs. Truth
> 
> **Universal Questions:**
> 
> * When do we speak and when do we listen?  
> * What requires denunciation and what requires annunciation?  
> * Who are we called to comfort and who to challenge?  
> * How do we witness suffering without consuming it?  
> * What prophecy does this moment demand?  
>   This is the explicitly prophetic thread \- the moral demand to name what others won't see.

**Missing incarnational theology.** Christians might ask: Where is the explicit commitment to the divine manifesting in the particular, the holy in the historical moment, God with us in struggle? The framework feels abstract where Christianity demands concrete engagement with suffering.

> ### **Reframing EMBODIMENT for Concrete Suffering**
> 
> **EMBODIMENT** (expanded) **Seed:** "Where does suffering live?"
> 
> **The Tension:** Transcendence vs. Immanence vs. Resistance
> 
> **Universal Questions:**
> 
> * Are bodies sites of oppression or sources of wisdom?  
> * How does trauma live in flesh and how does healing happen?  
> * Where does systemic violence meet individual bodies?  
> * What does liberation feel like in the body?  
> * How do we honor bodies that don't conform, can't produce, won't submit?  
>   This makes explicit: racism lives in threatened bodies, poverty lives in hungry bodies, patriarchy lives in controlled bodies. Liberation must also be embodied.

**No liberation narrative.** The Spiral is cyclical, but liberation theology is directional \- from bondage to freedom, from crucifixion to resurrection. Where is hope for actual transformation of oppressive systems?

> ### **BECOMING as Liberation Thread**
> 
> **BECOMING** (reframed) **Seed:** "What must die for us to be free?"
> 
> **The Tension:** What We Were vs. What We're Becoming vs. What We Must Become
> 
> **Universal Questions:**
> 
> * What systems must die for justice to live?  
> * Who are we becoming collectively, not just individually?  
> * How do we maintain identity while systems transform?  
> * What ancestral patterns do we break and which do we honor?  
> * Is transformation inevitable or must we fight for it?  
>   This explicitly connects personal and systemic transformation.

## **4\. The Earth-Centered Critique**

**Linear presentation of cyclical concept.** The Spiral is numbered 1-7, suggesting progression, when earth-centered practice knows cycles don't have beginning or end. Why not present as a web, wheel, or actual spiral?

> ### **Earth-Centered: Reimagining Presentation**
> 
> **Beyond Linear Numbering:**
> 
> The threads should be presented as a **web** or **medicine wheel**, not a list. Imagine:
> ```
>                    PRESENCE (East/Air/Dawn)
>                            |
>     UNCERTAINTY \--------PAUSE-------- CONSENT
>     (North/Earth/        (Center)      (South/Fire/
>      Midnight)                          Noon)
>            \\             |             /
>             \\            |            /
>      MEMORY---------EMBODIMENT--------POWER
>     (West/Water/    (Below/Body)    (Above/Sky)
>      Sunset)             |
>                     BECOMING
>                 (The Spiral/Season Turn)
> ```
> Or offer **multiple presentations**:
> 
> * Linear for those who need sequence  
> * Circular for those who think in cycles  
> * Web for those who see interconnection  
> * Spiral for those who understand both return and progression

**Disembodied language.** Despite the "Embodiment" thread, the framework is heavily conceptual. Where are the practices connected to seasons, elements, directions, moon phases \- the actual embodied wisdom of earth-centered traditions?

> **Embodied Practices for Each Thread:**
> 
> **PRESENCE**: Spring Equinox practice \- what's emerging NOW
> * New moon: What seeds are present?  
> * Full moon: What's illuminated?  
> * Dark moon: What presence exists in absence?  
> 
> **CONSENT**: Summer Solstice \- peak power of choice  
> * Fire ceremony: What do we choose to burn/transform?  
> * Water blessing: What do we allow to flow through us?  
> 
> **MEMORY**: Autumn Equinox/Samhain \- ancestors and harvest  
> * Ancestor altar: Which memories do we feed?  
> * Harvest ritual: What memories do we preserve, what do we compost?  
> 
> **PAUSE**: Winter Solstice \- the great stillness  
> * The longest night: Sitting with darkness  
> * Breath practice with bare trees: When life pauses, what remains?

**Too universal, not particular enough.** Earth-centered spirituality is about THIS land, THIS watershed, THESE ancestors. The framework's universality could erase the specificity that makes earth-centered practice powerful.

> **Localizing the Universal:**
> 
> Each congregation would develop **Place-Based Threads**:
> 
> * What tensions does THIS bioregion teach?  
> * Which ancestors (human and more-than-human) speak here?  
> * What does your watershed know about flow and obstruction?  
> * How does your soil teach about decomposition and growth?  
>   Example: A Pacific Northwest congregation might discover:  
> * **SALMON** thread: Return vs. Transformation (dying to feed the forest)  
> * **RAIN** thread: Saturation vs. Drought  
> * **CEDAR** thread: Giving Everything vs. Maintaining Heartwood

## **5\. The Buddhist Analysis**

**Unnecessary complexity.** Buddhism offers simple, elegant frameworks: Four Noble Truths, Eightfold Path, Three Marks of Existence. The Spiral's seven threads with multiple tensions each feels like conceptual proliferation that meditation practice specifically works to cut through.

> ### **Buddhist: Simplification and Compassion**
> 
> **The Radical Simplification:**
> 
> Instead of seven threads, offer **ONE PRACTICE**: *"Notice the tension. Breathe with it. Let it teach you."*
> 
> The threads become optional tools, not required learning:
> 
> * Some people need all seven named  
> * Some need just one to work with  
> * Some need none, just the practice  
>   Like Buddhist numbered lists, they're **pedagogical**, not ontological.

**Reifying what should be released.** By naming threads and tensions, you're creating more mental constructs to attach to. Buddhist practice might see this as adding suffering rather than alleviating it.

> **The Non-Attachment Reframe:**
> 
> "These aren't threads to grasp but **fingers pointing at the moon**. Once you see the moon (the nature of creative tension), forget the fingers."
> 
> Make explicit: The goal is to **experience** tension-as-teacher, not memorize categories. The threads are scaffolding to be dismantled once you can stand.

**Where is compassion?** The framework addresses wisdom (understanding tensions) but where is the explicit cultivation of compassion, loving-kindness, sympathetic joy?

> **Where Compassion Lives:**
> 
> Add the **HEART PRACTICES** for each thread:
> 
> **PRESENCE**: Loving-kindness for what is, not what we wish **CONSENT**: Compassion for our limitations and others' **MEMORY**: Forgiveness practice for what haunts **PAUSE**: Patience as form of love **EMBODIMENT**: Tenderness toward suffering bodies **UNCERTAINTY**: Gentle curiosity toward the unknown **BECOMING**: Sympathetic joy for what emerges
> 
> Or create the **COMPASSION** meta-thread: *"How do we hold tension with kindness rather than aggression?"*

## **6\. Institutional and Practical Concerns**

**Framework fatigue.** UU congregations are already juggling Article II revision, Soul Matters themes, UUA Common Read, various curricula. Adding another framework, however good, might overwhelm rather than help.

> ### **On Framework Fatigue**
> 
> Yes, UU congregations are overwhelmed. But The Spiral isn't ANOTHER framework \- it's a **meta-framework** for holding all the others. It answers: "How do we hold all these different approaches without choosing sides?"
> 
> The Spiral could be the container for:
> 
> * Article II discussions (holding tension between values)  
> * Soul Matters themes (each theme has tensions)  
> * Justice work (power tensions)  
> * Pastoral care (personal tensions)  
>   **Framework Fatigue: The Integration Solution**  
>   Don't add The Spiral to existing frameworks \- **show how it holds them**:  
> * **Soul Matters monthly themes**: Each theme contains tensions the Spiral names  
>   * "Heritage" month \= MEMORY thread  
>   * "Imagination" month \= UNCERTAINTY thread  
> * **Article II values**: Each value exists in tension with others  
>   * Justice ↔ Compassion (when do they conflict?)  
>   * Equity ↔ Transformation (what changes, what stays?)  
> * **Existing covenant groups**: Add one question: "What tension are we holding?"

**Training burden.** Who will train facilitators? What happens when it's misused? You're creating something that requires significant skill to facilitate well, but without institutional support structures.

> **Training Without Burden:**
> 
> Create **three levels of engagement**:
> 
> 1. **Basic** (no training needed): "Name a tension you're holding"  
> 2. **Facilitated** (half-day training): Leading Spiral practices  
> 3. **Advanced** (weekend intensive): Conflict transformation through Creative Tension  
>    But also: **Mistakes are data**. Document what happens when it's "misused" \- that's learning too. Build failure stories into the framework's evolution.

**The founder problem.** Despite open-sourcing, this is still "Ron's framework" in people's minds. UU has painful history with charismatic individuals creating movements that later problematize. How do you prevent becoming another UU personality-driven program?

> **The Founder Problem: Planned Obsolescence**
> 
> Build in your own irrelevance:
> 
> * **Rotate primary maintainers** of the GitHub repository annually  
> * **Create a council** of diverse theological voices to guide evolution  
> * **Pseudonymous option**: Allow contributions that supersede yours  
> * **Success metric**: When people stop calling it "Ron's framework"  
> * **The ultimate test**: Could it survive and thrive if you disappeared?  
>   Name the shadow explicitly: "Watch for when this framework becomes about me rather than the work. Call it out. That's practicing the framework."

**Measurement problem.** How do we know if it's working? Unlike covenant groups (measurable participation) or justice work (concrete outcomes), success in "holding creative tension" is entirely subjective.

> ### **On Measurement**
> 
> Success metrics could include:
> 
> * Decreased conflicts going to disruption  
> * Increased participation in difficult conversations  
> * More creative solutions emerging from disagreement  
> * Higher retention during congregational tension  
> * Measured increase in "tolerance for ambiguity" scores  
>   But also: Some transformations can't be measured, only witnessed.  
>   **Measurement: Multiple Metrics**  
>   **Quantitative:**  
> * Pre/post "Tolerance for Ambiguity" scales  
> * Conflict escalation rates  
> * Meeting participation during tense topics  
> * Retention during congregational stress  
>   **Qualitative:**  
> * Story collection: "How did holding tension change the outcome?"  
> * Art/poetry/movement expressions of tension  
> * Children's understanding of "both/and"  
>   **Embodied metrics:**  
> * Can people literally breathe during conflict?  
> * Do bodies soften or harden during tension?  
> * Does laughter emerge alongside disagreement?  
>   **But also admit**: Some transformations resist measurement. The butterfly can't quantify the caterpillar's dissolution.

## **7\. The Theological Coherence Question**

**Is this theology or psychology?** The framework straddles the line confusingly. It uses theological language (Process thought) but addresses psychological dynamics. This might satisfy neither those seeking spiritual depth nor those wanting psychological clarity.

> ### **The Theological Coherence Question**
> 
> **Is this theology or psychology?**
> 
> It's **praxis** \- where theology and psychology meet in lived experience. This isn't confusion but integration. The split between spiritual and psychological is itself a false Western binary that many traditions never accepted.
> 
> Consider parallels:
> 
> * **Zen koans**: Are they theology or psychology? Both/neither \- they're transformation technology  
> * **Liberation theology**: Consciously blends psychological conscientization with theological reflection  
> * **Indigenous practices**: Never separated healing mind from healing spirit  
>   The Spiral offers **phenomenology of transformation** \- describing what happens when humans engage creative tension, regardless of whether you explain it through:  
> * Divine action (theological)  
> * Neural rewiring (psychological)  
> * Systems dynamics (sociological)  
> * All of the above (integral)  
>   **The solution**: Be explicit about this integration. "The Spiral describes patterns that appear whether you interpret them spiritually, psychologically, or sociologically. Use whatever lens serves your understanding."

**Universal vs. Particular tension.** By trying to be universal, does it become so general it says nothing specific? But if it says something specific, is it truly universal? This is THE classic UU problem and the Spiral doesn't solve it, just reproduces it.

> ### **Universal vs. Particular: The Classic UU Problem**
> 
> You're right \- the Spiral reproduces this tension. **But that's the point.**
> 
> Instead of solving the universal/particular problem, the Spiral **names it as a creative tension to hold**. This could be its own thread:
> 
> **TRANSLATION** **Seed:** "What speaks to all and what speaks to each?" **Tension:** Universal patterns vs. Particular expressions
> 
> The framework is universal at the **structural** level (everyone navigates tensions) but particular at the **content** level (which tensions, how they're held).
> 
> Think of music: The octave is universal (physics), but scales are cultural (particular). The Spiral provides the octave; communities create their scales.
> 
> **Practical solution**: Each congregation develop
