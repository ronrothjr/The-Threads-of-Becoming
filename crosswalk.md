# **THREADS OF BECOMING**

Crosswalk Appendix

*Connections to Established Modalities*

For practitioners trained in other frameworks

## **Introduction**

The Threads of Becoming is designed to complement, not replace, existing therapeutic, coaching, and facilitation modalities. If you're trained in another framework, this crosswalk will help you see where Threads connects with what you already know—and where it offers something distinct.

### **How to Use This Document**

* Find the modality you're trained in

* See which Threads concepts map to familiar territory

* Note where Threads adds something your modality doesn't emphasize

* Use the integration suggestions to blend approaches

### **The Core Distinction**

Most frameworks treat tension as something to resolve. Threads treats tension as something to hold. This changes the facilitator's posture: you're not trying to move people from tension to resolution, but helping them stay in tension long enough for something new to emerge.

# **Internal Family Systems (IFS)**

### **Where They Connect**

| IFS Concept | Threads Connection |
| ----- | ----- |
| Self-energy (calm, curious, compassionate) | The facilitator's stance; "Creative Tension" center |
| Parts holding extreme positions | Collapse toward one pole |
| Unblending from parts | Returning from collapse to creative tension |
| Exiles (wounded parts carrying burdens) | MEMORY thread: Given stories, being "Told" |
| Protector parts (managers, firefighters) | Collapse as protective function |

### **What Threads Adds**

* Explicit relational and systemic application (couples, teams, communities)

* The seven threads as a diagnostic taxonomy for what's activated

* Emphasis on holding tension rather than healing parts

* Integration of philosophical framework (Process thought)

### **Integration Suggestion**

Use Threads to identify which tension is alive in a system, then use IFS techniques if working with individual parts. Threads can serve as a "triage" layer before deeper parts work.

# **Nonviolent Communication (NVC)**

### **Where They Connect**

| NVC Concept | Threads Connection |
| ----- | ----- |
| Needs (universal human needs) | The poles themselves represent competing needs |
| Feelings (connecting to inner experience) | EMBODIMENT thread: somatic awareness |
| Requests (clear, actionable asks) | CONSENT thread: Yes/No, sovereignty |
| Empathic listening | PRESENCE thread: quality of attunement |

### **What Threads Adds**

* Explicit attention to collapse dynamics (NVC can inadvertently collapse into formulaic exchange)

* The PAUSE and UNCERTAINTY threads (timing and not-knowing are underdeveloped in NVC)

* BECOMING thread for identity transformation (NVC focuses on present needs)

* Systemic application beyond dyadic communication

### **Integration Suggestion**

Use NVC's feelings/needs vocabulary within Threads' structure. When someone identifies a need, explore which pole it represents and what the complementary need might be. This prevents NVC from becoming a tool for one person to "get their needs met" at the expense of relational tension.

# **Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)**

### **Where They Connect**

| EFT Concept | Threads Connection |
| ----- | ----- |
| Negative interaction cycles | Partners collapsed toward opposite poles |
| Pursue/withdraw pattern | PRESENCE: Between vs. Within collapse |
| Primary emotions under secondary reactions | EMBODIMENT: accessing body data under cognition |
| Attachment injuries | MEMORY: inherited relational patterns |
| Softening events | Emergence from held creative tension |

### **What Threads Adds**

* A meta-language that works beyond attachment dynamics (teams, communities)

* CONSENT, PAUSE, and UNCERTAINTY threads (not emphasized in EFT)

* Framework for non-romantic relationships and organizational systems

* Explicit philosophical grounding

### **Integration Suggestion**

EFT practitioners can use Threads to identify the specific tension driving the negative cycle. The seven threads offer more granularity than EFT's primary focus on attachment. When you've named the cycle, ask: "Which thread is this—Presence, Consent, Memory?" This often reveals the specific engagement point.

# **Polarity Management / Polarity Thinking**

### **Where They Connect**

| Polarity Concept | Threads Connection |
| ----- | ----- |
| Polarities (interdependent pairs) | Core tensions (each thread has 2 tension pairs) |
| Upsides/downsides of each pole | Wisdom in each pole / collapse signs |
| Over-focus on one pole | Collapse |
| Leveraging polarities for greater purpose | Holding creative tension for emergence |

### **What Threads Adds**

* A defined taxonomy (seven threads) rather than infinite custom polarities

* Somatic and embodied dimension (Polarity Thinking is primarily cognitive)

* Diagnostic questions for in-session navigation

* Collapse as relational/systemic pattern, not just strategic error

* The spiral nature of development (BECOMING returns to PRESENCE)

### **Integration Suggestion**

Polarity practitioners can use the seven threads as a "starter set" of pre-identified polarities that show up universally. This accelerates diagnosis. When a new polarity emerges, ask: "Does this fit within one of the seven threads, or is it genuinely novel?"

# **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)**

### **Where They Connect**

| ACT Concept | Threads Connection |
| ----- | ----- |
| Cognitive defusion | MEMORY: moving from "Told" to "Telling" |
| Present moment awareness | PRESENCE: Here vs. Elsewhere |
| Acceptance (vs. experiential avoidance) | EMBODIMENT: Stay vs. Go; holding rather than fleeing |
| Self-as-context | BECOMING: identity as process, not fixed |
| Committed action toward values | PAUSE: discerning timing; CONSENT: choosing freely |

### **What Threads Adds**

* Explicit relational and systemic application (ACT is primarily individual)

* The CONSENT and UNCERTAINTY threads (less developed in ACT)

* A diagnostic taxonomy for quickly identifying what's activated

* The facilitator stance and session structure

### **Integration Suggestion**

ACT practitioners can use Threads as a relational extension. When a client is stuck in fusion or avoidance, identify which thread is activated. ACT techniques can then address the specific collapse. The Threads framework adds a vocabulary for what ACT calls "psychological flexibility" in relational systems.

# **Restorative Practice / Circle Process**

### **Where They Connect**

| Restorative Concept | Threads Connection |
| ----- | ----- |
| The circle as container | PRESENCE: creating space for mutual showing up |
| Storytelling / sharing impact | MEMORY: authoring shared narrative |
| Voluntary participation | CONSENT: sovereignty, real choice |
| Holding space for harm and healing | Holding creative tension without collapsing |
| Agreements / next steps | Integration phase: emergence into action |

### **What Threads Adds**

* A diagnostic layer for what's happening when circles get stuck

* PAUSE, UNCERTAINTY, and BECOMING threads (often implicit in circle work)

* Explicit collapse/emergence dynamics

* The seven threads as prompts for circle questions

### **Integration Suggestion**

Circle keepers can use the seven seed questions as round prompts. When a circle stalls, identify which thread is activated and use its diagnostic questions. Threads gives circle practice a diagnostic vocabulary for what's happening beneath the surface.

# **Bowen Family Systems Theory**

### **Where They Connect**

| Bowen Concept | Threads Connection |
| ----- | ----- |
| Differentiation (self vs. togetherness) | PRESENCE: Within ↔ Between; CONSENT: Self ↔ Other |
| Multigenerational transmission | MEMORY: Given ↔ Chosen stories |
| Emotional reactivity | Collapse (losing access to both poles) |
| Triangulation | Systemic collapse—tension exported to third party |
| Chronic anxiety in systems | UNCERTAINTY: Threat response; PAUSE: manufactured urgency |

### **What Threads Adds**

* Specific diagnostic questions for in-session use

* EMBODIMENT and BECOMING threads (underdeveloped in Bowen)

* The emergence concept (Bowen focuses on differentiation, not emergence)

* A structured session arc and scripted engagement

### **Integration Suggestion**

Bowen practitioners can use Threads for real-time navigation within sessions. Bowen provides the systemic diagnosis (triangles, fusion, cutoff); Threads provides the moment-to-moment facilitation moves. When you see emotional reactivity, identify which thread is collapsing and use its micro-engagement.
