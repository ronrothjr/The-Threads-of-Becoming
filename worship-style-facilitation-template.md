# Facilitation Template: Worship Style Tensions

**Navigating Worship Style Tensions Using the MEMORY Thread**
*Step-by-Step Meeting Guide | 90-Minute Session*

---

## The Scenario

**The Scenario:** Your congregation is polarized over worship style. One group wants to preserve traditional liturgy and hymns. Another group wants contemporary music and innovative formats. Board meetings are tense. Families are leaving. You're stuck.

**The Framework:** This is a classic *MEMORY thread* tension—the stories we inherit (Given/Tradition) versus the stories we author (Chosen/Innovation). Both poles hold wisdom. Both sides are protecting something sacred.

**This template** will guide you through a 90-minute facilitated conversation that helps your leadership team name the tension, honor both poles, and design forward without collapsing.

---

## Before the Meeting: Preparation

- **Who should attend:** Board members, worship leaders, representatives from both "sides" (invite 2-3 people who hold each pole strongly)
- **Room setup:** Circle or U-shape. Avoid boardroom-style rows. You want people to see each other.
- **Materials needed:** Whiteboard or flip chart, markers, copies of this guide for note-takers
- **Your role as facilitator:** You're not solving the problem. You're helping people *see the pattern* and *name what's at stake*. Stay neutral on the content, but directive on the process.
- **Set expectations:** Email participants 2-3 days before: "We're using a new framework to look at our worship tensions. The goal isn't to decide anything yet—it's to understand what we're protecting."

## Facilitation Script

### Phase 1: Opening: Name the Pattern (10 minutes)

**💬 Say:**
> "We're here because we're stuck on worship style. Before we dive into solutions or debate what to do, I want to try something different. I'm going to introduce a framework that helps us see the *pattern* underneath our tension. It's called Threads of Becoming, and the specific thread we're looking at is called MEMORY."

**Introduce the MEMORY thread:**

- Explain the tension: **Given (what we inherit) ↔ Chosen (what we author)**
- In worship: **Tradition (forms that carry our history) ↔ Innovation (expressions that reach new people)**
- Key insight: "Both poles are trying to protect something sacred. Our job today is to figure out what."

**⚠️ Watch For:**
If someone jumps to solutions ("Well, we should just do blended worship"), gently redirect: "Hold that thought. Before we design solutions, we need to understand what each side is protecting. Otherwise, we'll create something that satisfies no one."

---

### Phase 2: Identify the Poles (15 minutes)

**💬 Say:**
> "Let's name the two poles clearly. I'm going to draw them on the board. On one side, we have people drawn to tradition—inherited forms, established liturgy, the way we've worshiped for years. On the other side, we have people drawn to innovation—contemporary expressions, new music, reaching people who don't connect with traditional formats."

**Visual:**

```
GIVEN / TRADITION  ↔  CHOSEN / INNOVATION
"This is who we are.     "We must stay relevant.
Our forms carry meaning.  Growth requires change.
History matters."        Forms can evolve."
```

**Facilitator task:** Get agreement that these are the two poles. Ask: "Does this capture what we're wrestling with?"

**⚠️ Watch For:**
Some people will want to say "I'm not on either side!" That's okay. Acknowledge it: "You don't have to pick a side. But these are the two pulls we're navigating."

---

### Phase 3: Honor Both Poles: What Are We Protecting? (25 minutes)

**This is the heart of the facilitation.** You're going to help each "side" articulate what they're protecting—not what they're against, but what they're *for*.

**💬 Say (to tradition side):**
> "Now I want to hear from people who are drawn to tradition first. Not why the other side is wrong, but **what you're protecting.** What does traditional worship give us that matters? What would we lose if we abandoned it entirely?"

**Give 10 minutes for the "tradition" side.** Write their responses on the board. Listen for themes like:

- Continuity with generations before us
- Depth and theological richness in liturgy
- Stability and groundedness in forms that have held meaning
- Connection to something larger than current trends

**💬 Say (to innovation side):**
> "Thank you. Now I want to hear from people drawn to innovation and contemporary worship. Same question: **What are you protecting?** What does innovation give us that matters? What would we lose if we never changed?"

**Give 10 minutes for the "innovation" side.** Write their responses. Listen for:

- Accessibility for people unfamiliar with traditional forms
- Emotional engagement and experiential connection
- Reaching younger generations or unchurched neighbors
- Living tradition that adapts to context, not museum preservation

**Key facilitator move:** After both sides have spoken, pause and name what you heard:

**💬 Say:**
> "Here's what I'm noticing. The tradition side is protecting *depth, continuity, and rootedness*. The innovation side is protecting *accessibility, growth, and living expression*. Both are protecting something the congregation needs. Neither is wrong."

**⚠️ Watch For:**
If the conversation gets heated or defensive, pause and reframe: "We're not debating who's right. We're trying to see what both sides are protecting. That's different."

---

### Phase 4: Name the Collapse (15 minutes)

**Now help the group see how they've collapsed.** There are three common collapse patterns:

1. **Stuck at one pole:** We've chosen tradition OR innovation and dug in
2. **Oscillating:** We flip-flop between approaches, satisfying no one
3. **False compromise:** We blend in ways that lose the power of both (e.g., "contemporary hymns" that feel watered-down to everyone)

**💬 Say:**
> "Looking at our congregation honestly, where have we collapsed? Are we stuck defending one pole? Are we flip-flopping? Have we tried compromises that don't satisfy anyone?"

**Let the group name it.** This is a moment of honesty. It might feel uncomfortable. That's good.

**💡 Facilitator Tip:**
If people start blaming ("It's because the board won't listen!"), redirect: "The collapse isn't anyone's fault. It's a predictable pattern when we're facing a real tension. Now that we see it, we can choose differently."

---

### Phase 5: Hold the Tension: What Could Emerge? (20 minutes)

**This is where you shift from diagnosis to possibility.** You're not prescribing solutions—you're opening space for emergence.

**💬 Say:**
> "Here's the question I want us to sit with: **What might emerge if we held both poles at once?** Not traditional OR contemporary. Not a bland blend. But something that honors both depth and accessibility, both continuity and growth. What could that look like?"

**Brainstorm possibilities.** Encourage wild ideas. Don't evaluate yet. Possibilities might include:

- Services that pair traditional hymns with contemporary poetry/prayer
- Monthly rotation: traditional liturgy one week, contemporary format another
- "Woven liturgy"—blending inherited prayers with new expressions in the same service
- Teaching series that explains *why* traditional forms matter while introducing new practices
- Separate services that honor both (but with intentional connection points, not isolation)

**Write everything down.** No idea is too strange.

**⚠️ Watch For:**
If the group lands on one idea too quickly, slow down: "That might be part of it. Let's keep generating a few more possibilities before we decide."

---

### Phase 6: Close: Next Steps Without Collapsing (5 minutes)

**💬 Say:**
> "We're not deciding today. But we've done something important: we've named the tension, honored what both sides are protecting, and opened up some new possibilities. Here's what happens next..."

**Assign clear next steps:**

1. **Appoint a design team** (include people from both poles) to prototype 2-3 ideas from today's brainstorm
2. **Set a follow-up meeting** in 3-4 weeks to review prototypes
3. **Name the commitment:** "We're going to try to hold both poles. No one gets everything they want, but no one gets abandoned either."

**💡 Closing Prayer or Reflection:**

End with something that acknowledges the sacredness of the work:

> *"God of tradition and God of transformation, help us hold both. May we honor what you've given us and remain open to what you're still authoring. Amen."*

## After the Meeting: Follow-Up

### Essential Follow-Up Actions

- **Send a summary** within 48 hours: What we named, what we heard, what's next
- **Check in with both poles individually.** Ask: "How are you feeling about the conversation? What are you noticing?"
- **Keep naming the thread.** In sermons, in newsletters, in casual conversations: "We're learning to hold the MEMORY thread—honoring both tradition and innovation."
- **Celebrate small wins.** When something works that honors both poles, name it publicly

---

## What If It Doesn't Work?

Sometimes the tension is too hot to resolve in one meeting. That's okay. Here's what to do:

- **Don't force consensus.** If the group isn't ready, acknowledge that and schedule another conversation in a month.
- **Consider bringing in outside facilitation.** Sometimes you need a neutral third party who can hold the space without the baggage of congregational history.
- **Keep naming the pattern.** Even if nothing changes immediately, helping people *see* the MEMORY thread reduces its unconscious power.
- **Focus on your own leadership.** Model what it looks like to honor both poles in your own preaching and pastoral care.
