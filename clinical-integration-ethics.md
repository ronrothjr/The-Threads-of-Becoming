# **THREADS OF BECOMING**

## Clinical Integration & Ethics Guide

For Licensed Mental Health Professionals

The Creative Advance Institute

# **Introduction: Enhancement, Not Replacement**

This guide addresses a question every responsible clinician asks when encountering a new framework: *Is this within my scope of practice?*

The short answer: **Yes**—because Threads of Becoming is not a clinical intervention. It is a **diagnostic and conceptual lens** that enhances the clinical modalities you already practice.

Think of Threads the way you might think of attachment theory or polyvagal theory: a framework that helps you understand what's happening beneath the surface, organize your clinical observations, and make better decisions about intervention. You don't need special licensure to use attachment theory. You need clinical training to know what to *do* with your attachment-informed observations.

The same principle applies here. Threads certification indicates mastery of the framework—not clinical licensure. Your existing license governs what interventions you may provide. Threads simply gives you a more precise diagnostic vocabulary for the universal tensions that underlie so much human suffering and stuckness.

## **What Threads Provides**

* **Diagnostic precision:** Quickly identify which existential tension is activated when clients present with 'stuckness'  
* **Collapse recognition:** See patterns of protective rigidity that may be invisible within single-modality frameworks  
* **Integration language:** Give clients accessible vocabulary for complex internal experiences  
* **Treatment planning clarity:** Know which modality to apply and when, based on which thread is active  
* **Emergence tracking:** Recognize genuine integration versus intellectual insight

## **What Threads Does Not Provide**

* Clinical licensure or expanded scope of practice  
* Permission to diagnose or treat mental health conditions  
* A replacement for evidence-based clinical interventions  
* Training in trauma processing, EMDR, or other specialized protocols  
* Authority to work outside your existing competencies

# **Integration with Clinical Modalities**

Threads of Becoming integrates naturally with evidence-based clinical approaches. Below we map specific connections, showing how the seven threads illuminate dynamics you already work with—and how your existing modalities address the patterns Threads helps you see.

## **Internal Family Systems (IFS)**

**Core alignment:** IFS and Threads share a fundamental stance—curiosity rather than pathology, both/and rather than either/or. The Self energy that IFS cultivates mirrors the 'holding' stance Threads describes. Both frameworks trust that wisdom emerges when we stop trying to fix.

| Thread | IFS Translation | Clinical Application |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| PRESENCE | Parts polarized around connection vs. protection | Identify protectors guarding against intimacy; work with exiles carrying attachment wounds |
| CONSENT | Managers enforcing rigid boundaries; firefighters with no boundaries | Unblend from extreme protectors to access Self-led boundary setting |
| MEMORY | Exiles frozen in past narrative; parts that reject all history | Witness and unburden exiles; help system integrate past without being possessed by it |
| EMBODIMENT | Parts that intellectualize (managers) vs. parts that flood (firefighters/exiles) | Build somatic Self-energy; titrate approach to exiles; expand window of tolerance |
| BECOMING | Parts identified with old roles; legacy burdens blocking new identity | Help parts release outdated roles; create space for new self-conceptions from Self |

**Clinical workflow:**

* Use Threads to identify which existential tension is presenting  
* Use IFS to work with the parts polarized around that tension  
* Track emergence as unburdening allows the system to hold both poles

## **Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)**

**Core alignment:** EFT's attachment focus maps directly to the PRESENCE thread. The pursue-withdraw cycle EFT identifies is a perfect example of partners collapsed toward opposite poles. Softening events represent emergence from held tension.

| EFT Concept | Threads Translation | Integration Point |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Pursue-withdraw cycle | PRESENCE collapse: one partner in Between, one in Within | Name the shared thread; help each access wisdom in partner's pole |
| Attachment injury | MEMORY thread: frozen narrative about partner/relationship | Work with Given (what happened) and Chosen (story we tell now) |
| Softening event | Emergence: something new arising from held tension | Threads explains why softening happens and how to create conditions |

**Clinical workflow:**

* Map the couple's negative cycle to threads (often PRESENCE, CONSENT, or MEMORY)  
* Help each partner see they're collapsed toward opposite poles of the same tension  
* Use EFT techniques to access primary emotions; track emergence as softening occurs

## **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)**

**Core alignment:** ACT's hexaflex maps remarkably onto Threads. Cognitive defusion is MEMORY thread movement. Present-moment awareness is PRESENCE. Acceptance is EMBODIMENT. Values clarification is BECOMING. Threads extends ACT into relational and systemic domains.

| ACT Process | Thread Connection | Threads Enhancement |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Cognitive defusion | MEMORY: from Told (fused) to Telling (authoring) | Identify narrative patterns; honor what the story protected |
| Present moment | PRESENCE: cultivating Within; PAUSE: accessing Now | Distinguish grounded presence from reactive immediacy |
| Acceptance | EMBODIMENT: room for Feel without flooding/dissociating | Track window of tolerance; honor Think pole's protective function |
| Values | BECOMING: Same (what endures) and Different (who I'm becoming) | Distinguish core values from inherited 'shoulds' (MEMORY) |

**Clinical workflow:**

* Use Threads to diagnose which flexibility process is stuck  
* Apply ACT techniques for that specific inflexibility pattern  
* Extend into relational/systemic dimensions that ACT's individual focus may miss

## **Somatic & Trauma-Informed Approaches**

**Core alignment:** The EMBODIMENT thread is explicitly somatic—the tension between Think and Feel. Collapse in this thread mirrors dysregulation patterns. The window of tolerance concept maps directly to capacity to hold both poles.

**Integration with Somatic Experiencing, Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, EMDR:**

* **Dissociation:** EMBODIMENT collapse into Think—protective distance from overwhelming sensation  
* **Flooding:** EMBODIMENT collapse into Feel—overwhelmed without cognitive container  
* **Integration:** Dual awareness (both poles held) IS the goal of trauma processing  
* **Pendulation:** Titrated movement between poles to expand capacity  
* **Resource installation:** Building container that allows tension to be held without collapse

**Important clinical note:** Threads is NOT a trauma processing protocol. Use Threads to identify when EMBODIMENT is active and trauma work is indicated, then apply your trauma-specific training.

# **Scope of Practice Guidelines**

The following guidelines clarify how Threads certification relates to your existing clinical license.

## **What Threads Certification Authorizes**

* Using the seven-thread diagnostic framework to organize clinical observations  
* Teaching clients the Threads vocabulary as a psychoeducational tool  
* Facilitating Threadwork sessions within your existing scope  
* Using collapse/emergence language to track treatment progress  
* Applying seed questions as assessment and exploration tools  
* Integrating Threads insights with your primary clinical modality

## **What Remains Governed by Your License**

* Diagnosing mental health conditions (DSM/ICD)  
* Providing psychotherapy or counseling  
* Treating trauma, personality disorders, or severe mental illness  
* Making clinical decisions about medication, hospitalization, or safety  
* All other activities requiring professional licensure

## **When to Refer**

Even within your licensed scope, some situations require referral to specialists:

* **Active mental health crisis:** Suicidality, psychosis, severe dissociation, active substance crisis  
* **Safety concerns:** Abuse, domestic violence, child welfare issues, duty-to-warn situations  
* **Beyond your competence:** Specialized conditions without specific training  
* **Your own activation:** When your personal material interferes with clinical effectiveness  
* **Dual relationship concerns:** When boundaries cannot be maintained  
* **Medical concerns:** When symptoms may have organic basis requiring medical evaluation

# **Ethical Framework for Clinical Application**

The following ethical commitments supplement—not replace—your licensing board's ethical codes.

## **Core Ethical Commitments**

1. **Hold, Don't Fix**  
   Resist the therapeutic temptation to resolve tension prematurely. Trust that emergence happens when we hold space rather than engineer outcomes.

2. **Honor Both Poles**  
   Never advocate for one pole over another. Both carry essential truth. If you find yourself thinking one pole is 'healthier,' check your own collapse.

3. **Respect Autonomy**  
   The CONSENT thread applies to the therapeutic relationship itself. Offer the framework; don't impose it.

4. **Know Your Scope**  
   Threads certification does not expand your clinical scope. It provides a diagnostic tool to use within your existing competencies.

5. **Manage Your Own Activation**  
   Your own threads will activate in clinical work. Be aware when your material is influencing the work. Seek supervision.

6. **Maintain Confidentiality**  
   Standard clinical confidentiality applies. Exceptions: imminent danger, abuse, court order, and consultation with appropriate anonymization.

7. **Navigate Power Responsibly**  
   The therapeutic relationship involves inherent power dynamics. Frame observations as curiosity, not diagnosis. Invite exploration, not compliance.

# **Documentation Guidelines**

## **Recommended Documentation Practices**

* **Assessment notes:** Document threads as part of case conceptualization  
* **Session notes:** Note thread identification, collapse patterns, emergence indicators  
* **Treatment planning:** Frame goals in terms of expanding capacity to hold both poles  
* **Progress notes:** Track movement from collapse toward emergence  
* **Supervision records:** Document consultation including practitioner's own thread activation

## **Sample Documentation Language**

*Assessment example:*

"Client identified tension between connection needs (Between) and need for solitude (Within). Currently collapsed toward Within with limited access to relational needs. Treatment focus: gradual expansion of capacity to hold both poles through EFT-informed attachment work."

*Progress note example:*

"Session focused on EMBODIMENT thread. Client initially in Think pole (intellectualizing). Using grounding techniques, accessed Feel pole at low intensity without dissociation. Emergence indicator: spontaneous statement 'I can see why I had to shut down—and also feel how much it cost me.'"

# **Clinical Red Flags & Contraindications**

While Threads is broadly applicable, certain situations require caution or modification:

1. **Active trauma symptoms**  
   When clients are acutely distressed, stabilize first. Introduce Threads once window of tolerance has expanded.

2. **Personality organization with splitting**  
   Clients with borderline/narcissistic features may struggle with 'both/and' thinking. Build alliance and mentalization first.

3. **Psychotic processes**  
   Do not introduce abstract frameworks to clients experiencing active psychosis. 'Tension' and 'emergence' language could be incorporated into delusional material.

4. **Severe dissociation**  
   EMBODIMENT work may be contraindicated until clients have sufficient grounding resources. Partner with trauma specialist if outside your training.

5. **Intellectual defensiveness**  
   If a client becomes expert at analyzing threads while remaining defended, the framework is being used for collapse (into Think). Name this pattern compassionately.

6. **Couples with active abuse**  
   In IPV situations, 'honoring both poles' could minimize harm. Safety always comes first. Threads work requires genuine partnership, not power-over dynamics.

# **Quick Reference: Threads & Clinical Presentations**

| Thread | Common Presentations | DSM/Clinical Correlates |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **PRESENCE** Within / BetweenHere / Elsewhere | Isolation, codependency, fear of intimacy, enmeshment, avoidant attachment | Attachment disorders, social anxiety, dependent personality, schizoid patterns |
| **CONSENT** Yes / NoSelf / Other | Boundary issues, people-pleasing, rigidity, power struggles, inability to say no | Passive-aggressive, oppositional features, trauma responses to violation |
| **MEMORY** Given / ChosenTelling / Told | Stuck in past, denial of history, rigid narratives, identity confusion, rootlessness | PTSD/C-PTSD, grief disorders, identity disturbance, dissociative amnesia |
| **PAUSE** Not Yet / NowMore / Enough | Procrastination, impulsivity, decision paralysis, compulsive action, analysis paralysis | ADHD patterns, OCD, anxiety-driven avoidance, impulse control issues |
| **EMBODIMENT** Think / FeelStay / Go | Intellectualization, emotional flooding, dissociation, somatic symptoms, alexithymia | Somatic symptom disorders, dissociative disorders, emotion dysregulation |
| **UNCERTAINTY** Hide / SeekThreat / Welcome | Chronic worry, reckless risk-taking, need for certainty, catastrophizing, naive optimism | Generalized anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, mania features, risk-taking |
| **BECOMING** Same / DifferentReturn / Forward | Identity confusion, rigid self-concept, impostor syndrome, chronic reinvention, midlife crisis | Identity disturbance, adjustment disorders, developmental transitions |

# **Conclusion: A Lens, Not a License**

Threads of Becoming offers clinicians a unified diagnostic vocabulary for the existential tensions underlying human suffering. Clients speak the language of symptoms—anxiety, depression, relationship problems. Threads helps you hear the deeper pattern.

But a diagnostic lens is not an intervention protocol. Your clinical training tells you what to do once you see the pattern. Threads helps you see it.

This means you can integrate Threads immediately without scope creep. You're not adding a treatment modality—you're adding a conceptual tool that makes your existing modalities more precise.

The seven threads are not new truths. They name tensions you already work with. What Threads provides is the *map*—a way of organizing observations that helps you navigate with greater confidence.

Your clients are already navigating these tensions. Threads gives you—and them—a shared language for the journey.

**THE THREADS OF BECOMING**

# **Ethics Case Bank**

Scenarios for Training and Reflection

*24 Cases Across Contexts*

Individual Practice • Dyadic Work • Group Facilitation

Organizational Consulting • Training & Supervision

The Creative Advance Institute  
Version 1.0

# **Introduction**

This case bank provides scenarios for ethics training across all tiers of Threads certification. Each case represents situations practitioners actually encounter—some straightforward, others requiring careful discernment.

*These cases are composites. Any resemblance to specific individuals is coincidental.*

## **How to Use This Resource**

**In Tier 2 Training (Module 4):** Use cases 1-12 to introduce ethical boundaries and scope of practice. Focus on the individual and dyadic contexts most relevant to Practitioner certification.

**In Tier 3 Training (Module 6):** Use cases 13-24 to explore complex organizational and supervisory ethics. These cases often involve competing obligations and systemic dynamics.

**In Supervision:** Select cases relevant to issues arising in candidates' practice. Use the analysis framework to structure discussion.

**In Community of Practice:** Rotate through cases for ongoing ethics reflection. Experienced practitioners may contribute new cases.

## **Severity Levels**

| Low | Common situations with relatively clear paths forward. Good for building foundational ethical reasoning. |
| :---: | :---- |
| **Medium** | Situations requiring careful judgment. Multiple reasonable approaches may exist. Good for developing discernment. |
| **High** | Complex situations with significant stakes. May involve competing ethical obligations or potential harm. Requires experienced supervision. |

## **Analysis Framework**

For each case, consider:

* What ethical principles are in tension?  
* What is the practitioner's scope of practice?  
* What are the potential harms of action vs. inaction?  
* What would honoring both poles look like here?  
* When should the practitioner refer, consult, or decline?

# **Section 1: Individual Practice Cases**

Cases 1-6 focus on ethical issues in one-on-one Threadwork session Conversations.

| CASE 1: The Therapy Request | Low |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

You are a certified coach using Threads with individual clients. A client who has benefited from Threadwork sessions says: "This is so much more helpful than my therapist. Can I just work with you instead?"

### **The Tension**

The client is experiencing genuine benefit and wants more. You're being asked to replace a clinical provider.

### **Key Questions**

* What is your scope as a Threads Practitioner?  
* How do you honor the client's experience while maintaining boundaries?  
* What might be happening with the therapy relationship?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS This is a scope of practice issue. Threads is not therapy, and practitioners should not position themselves as replacements for clinical care. The appropriate response: Validate the benefit while clarifying scope. 'I'm glad our work is helpful. What we do here is different from therapy—complementary, not replacement. What feels different about this space?' This opens exploration without collusion. The client's comparison may reveal something useful for their therapy. Consider: 'Would you be willing to share what's working here with your therapist?' |
| :---- |

| CASE 2: The Disclosure | Medium |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

During a Threadwork session exploring the MEMORY thread (Given/Chosen), a client reveals childhood abuse for the first time. They seem relieved to have spoken it, but are clearly activated. This was not part of their presenting concern.

### **The Tension**

The client has made a significant disclosure. They need support, but processing trauma is outside Threads scope.

### **Key Questions**

* How do you hold space for this moment without becoming the trauma processor?  
* What does appropriate support look like right now?  
* When and how do you introduce the need for specialized care?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS This requires holding two things: honoring the significance of the disclosure while recognizing scope limits. In the moment: Ground the client. 'Thank you for trusting me with that. Let's take a breath together.' Ensure they're not leaving dysregulated. Before the session ends: 'What you shared is significant. This work is beyond what we do in our Threads conversations. Do you have a therapist, or would you like help finding one?' Do not attempt to process the trauma. Do not pretend the disclosure didn't happen. Walk the middle path: witness without treating. |
| :---- |

| CASE 3: The Friend Request | Low |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

A close friend learns you're a Certified Threads Practitioner and asks you to facilitate a Threadwork session with them about their marriage.

### **The Tension**

You have the skills they need. They trust you. But dual relationships complicate professional work.

### **Key Questions**

* Can you maintain professional neutrality with a close friend?  
* What happens to the friendship if the conversation goes poorly?  
* Is there a middle path between full professional engagement and declining entirely?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS Dual relationships are generally contraindicated. The power dynamics shift when a friend becomes a 'client,' and the friendship may not survive professional distance. Best practice: 'I'm honored you'd trust me with this. Because we're close friends, I'm not the right person to facilitate—I can't be neutral about your wellbeing the way a practitioner needs to be. Can I recommend someone?' Middle path (if appropriate): Offer to explain the framework so they can explore it themselves, without taking the facilitator role. |
| :---- |

| CASE 4: The Suicidal Ideation | High |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

A client exploring UNCERTAINTY (Hide/Seek) mentions, almost in passing: "Sometimes I think everyone would be better off without me." When you gently follow up, they minimize: "I didn't mean it like that. Can we get back to the uncertainty thing?"

### **The Tension**

The client has said something concerning but wants to move on. You're not a crisis counselor, but you can't ignore potential danger.

### **Key Questions**

* How do you assess whether this is passive ideation or active risk?  
* What's your obligation when a client minimizes after disclosing?  
* How do you handle safety without making the client feel pathologized?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS Safety always takes precedence over scope. This requires direct follow-up, not subtle redirection. Essential response: 'I heard what you said, and I need to pause on it. When you said everyone would be better off without you—can you help me understand that more?' If there is active suicidal ideation with plan or intent: This is a crisis. Connect to emergency services. You cannot 'hold space' for someone in acute danger. If passive ideation without plan: 'I want to continue our work, and I also want to make sure you have support for these kinds of thoughts. Are you connected with a therapist or counselor?' Document the disclosure and your response. Consult with a supervisor or clinical professional. |
| :---- |

| CASE 5: The Imposed Framework | Medium |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

You're certain a client's presenting issue is a CONSENT thread collapse—they can't say no and are exhausted from over-commitment. But every time you offer the framework, they redirect to other topics. After three sessions, you haven't been able to introduce the CONSENT thread at all.

### **The Tension**

You can see what they can't see. But Threads itself teaches that we honor autonomy. Imposing the framework violates the framework.

### **Key Questions**

* How long do you persist before accepting their resistance?  
* Is there a way to honor their autonomy while still serving them?  
* What might their resistance be telling you?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS This is the CONSENT thread playing out in the facilitation relationship. The client who can't say 'no' may be saying 'no' to your framework. The meta-move: 'I've noticed that when I offer a particular lens, you redirect. I want to honor that. Can we talk about what would be most useful for you in our time together?' You may need to accept that this client is not ready for this work—and that accepting their 'no' IS the work. Paradox: Your willingness to let go of your diagnosis may be exactly what creates space for them to access it. |
| :---- |

| CASE 6: The Collapse Into Advice | Low |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

A client is clearly suffering in an unhealthy relationship. You've helped them identify the PRESENCE thread, and they can articulate both poles. But they keep asking: "So should I leave or stay?" You have an opinion.

### **The Tension**

You're supposed to hold, not fix. But they're in pain and asking directly.

### **Key Questions**

* What's the difference between withholding wisdom and honoring emergence?  
* Can you share perspective without collapsing into one pole?  
* What does the client actually need from you?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS This is perhaps the most common ethical challenge: the temptation to fix. Your opinion about their relationship is irrelevant to the Threads work. Core response: 'I notice you're asking me to collapse the tension for you. What would it mean if you could hold both possibilities—staying AND leaving—a little longer?' If they persist: 'My role isn't to tell you what to do. It's to help you access the wisdom that's already in you. What does the part of you that knows the answer say?' Important: If they're in danger (abuse, violence), safety overrides this principle. 'Stay or leave' is different from 'are you safe.' |
| :---- |

# **Section 2: Dyadic Practice Cases**

Cases 7-12 focus on ethical issues when working with couples, pairs, or two-party conflicts.

| CASE 7: The Secret Disclosure | High |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

You're working with a couple on a PRESENCE thread issue. Before a joint session, one partner emails you: "I need to tell you something I can't say in front of my spouse. I've been having an affair. I'm not ready to disclose yet but thought you should know."

### **The Tension**

You now hold information that changes everything. You cannot un-know it. Continuing with the couple without disclosure feels dishonest. Forcing disclosure violates the sender's autonomy.

### **Key Questions**

* Can you continue to work with the couple while holding this secret?  
* What are your obligations to each party?  
* How do you handle the request for confidentiality within a dyadic context?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS This is why clear agreements at the outset are essential. Best practice: establish a 'no secrets' policy at intake for couples work. If you didn't have such an agreement: 'I appreciate you trusting me with this. I'm not able to hold significant secrets while working with you as a couple—it compromises my ability to be present with both of you equally.' Options: (1) Pause couples work until they're ready to be fully transparent, (2) Help the disclosing partner prepare for disclosure in individual session, (3) Refer the couple to another practitioner. What you cannot do: Continue as if you don't know. This creates a triangle that undermines the work. |
| :---- |

| CASE 8: The Power Imbalance | Medium |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

You're facilitating a Threadwork session between a manager and direct report who are in conflict. Both agreed to the session. But as it unfolds, you notice the employee deferring, minimizing, and apologizing excessively. The manager seems oblivious to the power differential.

### **The Tension**

Threads asks you to maintain neutrality. But neutrality in an unequal situation may perpetuate harm.

### **Key Questions**

* How do you name power dynamics without taking sides?  
* What does 'honoring both poles' mean when one party has structural power?  
* Should you have accepted this configuration in the first place?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS Power differentials complicate dyadic work. The employee cannot be fully authentic when their livelihood depends on the manager's perception. Naming the dynamic: 'I'm noticing something that might be important. \[To employee\]: Is there anything about this conversation that feels harder because of your work relationship?' Give them permission to acknowledge the constraint. Systemic move: 'I wonder if this conversation needs to happen at a different level—perhaps with HR or a third party who can hold the power dynamics more explicitly.' Learning: Before accepting dyadic work across power differentials, assess whether authentic engagement is possible. |
| :---- |

| CASE 9: The Abusive Dynamic | High |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

A couple presents with what they call 'communication issues.' As you work with them, you begin to see patterns consistent with emotional abuse: one partner controls, criticizes, and isolates; the other minimizes and takes blame. They want you to help them 'communicate better.'

### **The Tension**

'Honoring both poles' could be used to normalize abuse. The controlling partner might use Threads language to manipulate further.

### **Key Questions**

* When does 'both poles carry truth' not apply?  
* How do you protect the vulnerable partner without making things worse?  
* What's your obligation when continuing could cause harm?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS Abuse is not a 'tension to hold.' It is harm that needs to stop. Threads is contraindicated in active abuse situations. Do not proceed with couples work. The abusive partner may weaponize the framework; the victimized partner cannot speak freely. If you suspect abuse: 'I'm noticing some patterns that make me concerned about continuing our work together. I'd like to meet with each of you individually before we proceed.' In individual session with victimized partner: Assess safety. Provide resources. Make clear this is not a 'communication' issue. Do not confront the abusive partner directly in joint session—this may escalate danger to the victimized partner. |
| :---- |

| CASE 10: The Triangulation Attempt | Medium |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

You've been working with a couple for several sessions. After a particularly difficult session, one partner calls you and spends twenty minutes criticizing their spouse and asking if you agree. They want to know 'what you really think' about their partner.

### **The Tension**

The caller is seeking an ally. They want you to validate their position and collapse into their pole.

### **Key Questions**

* How do you maintain neutrality while still being responsive?  
* What boundaries need to exist around between-session contact?  
* How do you address this without shaming the caller?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS This is an attempt to triangulate you into their conflict. If you agree with their criticisms, you've lost neutrality. If you disagree, you've taken the other side. Response: 'I hear that you're frustrated. I'm not able to discuss your partner with you outside our sessions together—that wouldn't be fair to either of you. Can this wait until we're all together?' Systemic fix: Establish clear between-session communication policies at intake. 'I don't discuss one partner with the other outside sessions.' In next joint session: 'One of you reached out between sessions. I want to name that and invite you to bring whatever needed to be said into our shared space.' |
| :---- |

| CASE 11: The Religious Difference | Low |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

You're working with a couple where one partner is devoutly religious and the other is atheist. The religious partner believes divorce is morally wrong; the atheist partner sees nothing inherently wrong with ending an unhappy marriage. They're exploring BECOMING (Same/Different) as one partner considers a major life change.

### **The Tension**

Their value systems are fundamentally different. 'Honoring both poles' means honoring irreconcilable worldviews.

### **Key Questions**

* How do you facilitate when partners have incompatible values?  
* Can Threads hold religious and secular perspectives equally?  
* What's the difference between values and poles?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS This is not primarily about the facilitator's beliefs—it's about creating space where both partners' values are honored without adjudication. Key reframe: The thread is not 'religious vs. secular.' The thread might be MEMORY (the story of what marriage means) or BECOMING (who they each are becoming). Facilitation move: 'You each carry a story about what marriage means. Can you help each other understand what it would cost you to abandon your understanding?' This surfaces what each pole protects. Important: You don't need to resolve the values difference. You need to help them hold the tension of living with irreducible difference—which may lead to staying together with difference, or separating with mutual respect. |
| :---- |

| CASE 12: The One Who Doesn't Want To Be There | Low |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

A couple arrives and one partner is clearly reluctant. They're doing this 'for the relationship' but their body language screams resistance. The eager partner keeps looking to you to 'make them engage.'

### **The Tension**

You can't facilitate with someone who hasn't consented. But naming this might blow up the session before it starts.

### **Key Questions**

* How do you honor the reluctant partner's autonomy?  
* What's the minimum viable consent for proceeding?  
* When is the meta-conversation the only conversation worth having?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS The CONSENT thread is already activated. The reluctant partner's resistance IS the information. Address it directly: 'Before we begin, I want to check in with both of you about being here. \[To reluctant partner\]: What would make this time useful for you? Or would you prefer not to do this right now?' Give genuine permission to leave: 'It's okay if this isn't the right time. We can reschedule, or not. What matters is that you're both choosing to be here.' If they stay: 'Thank you for choosing to stay. What would you need to feel like this was worth your time?' This shifts from compliance to participation. |
| :---- |

# **Section 3: Group & Organizational Cases**

Cases 13-18 focus on ethical issues in group facilitation and organizational consulting.

| CASE 13: The Scapegoated Member | Medium |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

You're facilitating a team Threadwork session about an organizational tension. As the conversation unfolds, the group begins blaming one team member for everything. Others pile on. The targeted person shrinks.

### **The Tension**

The group has collapsed into blaming rather than holding tension. But intervening might feel like you're 'protecting' the scapegoat—taking sides.

### **Key Questions**

* When does group dynamics cross into harm you must address?  
* How do you interrupt scapegoating without rescuing?  
* What systemic function is the scapegoat serving?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS Scapegoating is a collective collapse—the group exports tension onto one person to avoid holding it themselves. This must be named. Interrupt the pattern: 'I want to pause here. I'm noticing that a lot of the tension in the room is being directed at one person. What might this group be avoiding by focusing on \[name\]?' Protect without rescuing: 'I want to check in with you \[to scapegoat\]. How are you doing? Is there anything you need right now?' Redirect to system: 'What would this conversation look like if \[name\] wasn't in the room? What tension would remain?' The scapegoat is carrying something for the system. Help the system take it back. |
| :---- |

| CASE 14: The Leader Who Hired You | Medium |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

The CEO hired you to help the leadership team 'improve communication.' As you work with them, it becomes clear the CEO's own behavior is a significant source of dysfunction. The team is afraid to say this with the CEO present.

### **The Tension**

You're accountable to the person paying you. But serving the system may require confronting that person.

### **Key Questions**

* How do you honor the person who hired you while serving the whole system?  
* What's the difference between confidential feedback and triangulation?  
* When does loyalty to the client organization override loyalty to the individual client?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS This is a structural challenge. You must clarify early who your 'client' is—the individual who hired you, or the organization. If possible, establish upfront: 'My client is the leadership team's effectiveness, not any individual. I'll share observations about patterns I see, including ones involving you.' If this clarity doesn't exist: Request individual time with the CEO. 'In my work with the team, I'm noticing some patterns I'd like to explore with you. Would you be open to feedback?' Frame as service, not confrontation: 'I think there's something happening that, if you understood it, would help you get more of what you're wanting from the team.' If the CEO is unwilling to receive feedback: You may not be able to help this system. Consider whether continued engagement is ethical. |

| CASE 15: The Confidential Information | High |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

You're consulting with an organization on a significant decision. In a private conversation, a senior leader reveals that layoffs are coming—information that isn't public. In a subsequent group session, team members are discussing long-term projects, unaware their jobs may not exist.

### **The Tension**

You hold information that affects everyone in the room. Sharing it would violate confidence. Staying silent feels deceptive.

### **Key Questions**

* What confidentiality obligations apply in organizational consulting?  
* Can you continue facilitating when you hold material secrets?  
* What's your obligation to the people in the room?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS This is similar to Case 7 (the affair disclosure) at organizational scale. You cannot hold information that fundamentally changes the conversation. First move: Return to the senior leader. 'The information you shared makes it difficult for me to facilitate authentically with the team. Can we discuss timing and disclosure?' Advocate for transparency: 'I think the team deserves to know the context for decisions we're asking them to make. Is there a way to share this?' If transparency is refused: 'I'm not able to continue facilitating while holding this information. It compromises my integrity and the team's ability to make informed decisions.' You may need to withdraw from the engagement. Your integrity matters more than the contract. |
| :---- |

| CASE 16: The Political Pressure | High |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

You're facilitating a congregation's discernment process about a contentious social issue. Before a key session, a major donor contacts you: 'I'm watching how this goes. If it goes the wrong way, I'll pull my pledge.' They make clear which outcome they want.

### **The Tension**

You're being pressured to influence an outcome. The donor is using power to shape a discernment process that should be open.

### **Key Questions**

* How do you handle external pressure on facilitation?  
* What's your obligation to the congregation versus the individual donor?  
* Should you disclose this contact to the congregation?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS This is an attempt to corrupt a discernment process through financial pressure. You cannot allow it to succeed. Response to donor: 'I understand you care deeply about this. My role is to hold space for the congregation's discernment, not to influence outcomes. I can't guarantee what will emerge.' Disclose the contact: You should inform congregational leadership that pressure was attempted. 'Someone tried to influence my facilitation. I declined. I thought you should know.' In facilitation: Be especially vigilant about your own neutrality. The donor has planted a seed you must consciously resist. Important: If you cannot remain neutral after this contact, you should recuse yourself. |
| :---- |

| CASE 17: The Unsafe Space | Medium |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

You're facilitating a discussion about diversity in an organization. A participant makes comments that others find offensive—not violent threats, but microaggressions and dismissive statements about protected groups. Some participants look uncomfortable; others seem to agree with the speaker.

### **The Tension**

'Honoring both poles' could be misread as platforming harmful views. But silencing voices creates its own harm.

### **Key Questions**

* When does 'holding tension' become complicity with harm?  
* How do you protect marginalized participants while remaining open?  
* What's the difference between discomfort and danger?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS Distinction matters: Discomfort with difference is holdable. Active harm to participants is not. Naming impact: 'I want to pause and check in. I noticed some reactions to what was just said. \[To affected participants\]: How are you doing? Is there anything you want to say?' Creating conditions: 'We're going to hold multiple perspectives here. AND we're going to do so in ways that don't diminish anyone's humanity or experience.' If behavior continues: 'I need to name that certain framings are creating conditions where not everyone can participate fully. Can we find ways to express these perspectives that don't dehumanize?' You may need to take a break, have offline conversation with the speaker, or in extreme cases end the session. |
| :---- |

| CASE 18: The Predetermined Outcome | Medium |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

An organization hires you to facilitate a 'discernment process' about a strategic direction. As you dig in, you realize leadership has already decided. They want you to create the appearance of participatory process to generate buy-in for a done deal.

### **The Tension**

They're hiring you for theater, not facilitation. But they may not see it that way—they may genuinely believe they're being open.

### **Key Questions**

* Can you ethically facilitate a process that isn't authentic?  
* How do you confront leadership without losing the engagement?  
* Is there a way to make this process genuine?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS Facilitation ethics require genuine openness. If the outcome is predetermined, you're providing cover, not facilitation. Probe before confronting: 'Help me understand what outcome flexibility exists. What could emerge from this process that would change the direction? What's genuinely open to influence?' If genuinely closed: 'What I'm hearing is that the direction is decided and you want help with implementation. That's a different kind of work. I can help with that—but let's call it what it is.' If partially open: 'Let's be clear with participants about what's decided and what's genuinely open. Transparency about constraints actually increases trust.' What you cannot do: Pretend a process is discernment when it's communication. This violates participant trust and your integrity. |

# **Section 4: Training & Supervision Cases**

Cases 19-24 focus on ethical issues specific to Tier 3 facilitators who train and supervise others.

| CASE 19: The Struggling Candidate | Medium |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

You're supervising a Tier 2 candidate who is not meeting competency standards. They're earnest and motivated, but their practice recordings show consistent diagnostic errors and an inability to hold space without fixing. The certification deadline is approaching.

### **The Tension**

You want to support their development, but certification requires meeting standards. Passing someone who isn't ready harms future clients.

### **Key Questions**

* How do you balance encouragement with honest assessment?  
* What's your obligation to future clients versus this candidate?  
* When is 'not yet' different from 'not suited for this work'?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS The Extended Engagement Pathway exists for exactly this situation. 'Not yet ready' is not 'failed'—it's information about development needs. Honest conversation: 'I want to be direct with you. Based on what I'm seeing, you're not yet ready for certification. This isn't about your worth—it's about competency development. Here's what I'm seeing...' Specific feedback: Vague encouragement doesn't help. Name exactly what needs to develop and how you'll assess progress. Option clarity: 'Here are the paths forward: additional practice with targeted supervision, module re-engagement, or personal work on your own patterns that might be interfering. What feels right to you?' The kindest thing is honesty. Passing them before they're ready sets them up for harm—to their clients and to their confidence when they struggle. |
| :---- |

| CASE 20: The Supervisor's Activation | Medium |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

You're supervising a candidate whose presenting case involves a parenting conflict. You realize you're having strong reactions—your own childhood wounds are activated. You find yourself giving advice rather than facilitating learning.

### **The Tension**

You're supposed to be the one holding space. But your own material is interfering.

### **Key Questions**

* When does a supervisor need to recuse themselves?  
* How do you acknowledge activation without making it about you?  
* What does modeling self-awareness look like?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS This is inevitable—Threads work activates practitioners at every level. The question is what you do with it. Acknowledge internally first: Name to yourself what's happening. 'I'm activated. My own MEMORY thread is up.' If you can recover: 'I notice I was giving advice just now. Let me step back. What are YOU noticing about this case?' If you cannot recover in the moment: 'I want to pause. Something in this case is touching something in me that's making it hard for me to be fully present as your supervisor. Can we come back to this next week?' Model the learning: 'This is what we teach—noticing when our own threads are activated. What I just demonstrated is the importance of that self-awareness.' Follow up: Get your own supervision or consultation on what was activated. |
| :---- |

| CASE 21: The Boundary Crossing Trainee | High |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

You learn that a Tier 2 candidate, not yet certified, has been advertising themselves as a 'Threads Practitioner' and charging clients for Threadwork sessions. When confronted, they say: 'But I'm almost certified, and people need help now.'

### **The Tension**

Their intentions may be good, but they're misrepresenting their credentials and practicing without certification.

### **Key Questions**

* What are the consequences for credential misrepresentation?  
* How do you handle this without destroying the relationship?  
* What systemic protections should exist?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS This is a serious ethics violation. Good intentions don't excuse misrepresenting credentials. Immediate response: 'You need to stop advertising as a Threads Practitioner immediately. You're not yet certified, and representing yourself as such is a violation of our ethics agreements.' Explore what happened: 'Help me understand what led you to do this.' Listen for whether this is poor judgment or character issue. Consequences should fit severity: At minimum, pause certification process. Require remediation. May require starting over or permanent exclusion depending on circumstances. Systemic learning: Does the training program need clearer communication about scope during training? Better enforcement mechanisms? Protect the framework: 'Part of what we're protecting is the integrity of the certification. If uncertified people practice under our name and cause harm, it damages everyone.' |
| :---- |

| CASE 22: The Request to Skip Levels | Low |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

A licensed therapist with 20 years of experience applies directly to Tier 3\. They argue that Tier 1 and 2 would be redundant given their clinical background. They want to jump straight to Facilitator training.

### **The Tension**

Their experience is real. But so is the value of the progressive training pathway.

### **Key Questions**

* When, if ever, is experience equivalent to training?  
* What does the tiered structure protect?  
* How do you honor expertise while maintaining standards?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS The temptation is to make exceptions for impressive candidates. Resist this. The pathway exists for reasons: 'The tiered structure isn't just about content—it's about formation. Tier 1 builds shared vocabulary. Tier 2 develops specific Threads competencies that clinical training doesn't cover. Tier 3 requires demonstrated Practitioner competence.' Possible accommodation: 'We can accelerate Tier 1—you might attend as an observer and help teach. But Tier 2 requires demonstrated Threadwork competency that your clinical experience, however excellent, doesn't automatically provide.' Protect the community: 'Part of what makes the community of practice work is shared formation. Everyone has walked the same path.' If they're unwilling: They may not be the right fit for this community. Someone who won't submit to a process may not be suited to facilitating one. |
| :---- |

| CASE 23: The Dual-Role Supervisor | Medium |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

You're a CTF at a midsize organization. Your employer wants you to both supervise staff members seeking Threads certification AND serve as their work supervisor. One of your supervisees is struggling in their certification work, and it's affecting your assessment of their job performance.

### **The Tension**

The roles are conflicting. Certification supervision requires a different relationship than work supervision.

### **Key Questions**

* Can the same person hold both supervisory roles?  
* How do you prevent contamination between domains?  
* What structural solutions might work?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS Dual roles create inherent conflicts. The certification candidate cannot be fully vulnerable in supervision if it might affect their job security. Best practice: Separate the roles. 'For your Threads certification, you should work with a different supervisor. I can arrange for \[colleague\] to provide that supervision.' If separation is impossible: Create clear boundaries. 'In our Threads supervision, we're looking at your development as a practitioner. I will not use what we discuss here in your performance reviews. What happens in this room stays here.' Document the separation: Make clear agreements in writing about what information can and cannot cross domains. If certification struggles affect job performance: Address the job performance directly based on job-related observations, not supervision content. |
| :---- |

| CASE 24: The Facilitator Who Should Step Back | High |
| :---- | :---: |

### **Context**

A CTF colleague and friend is going through a significant personal crisis—divorce, health scare, major depression. They continue to lead trainings and supervise candidates, but you're hearing concerns from participants about their presence being 'off.' When you ask, they say they're fine and need the work to stay grounded.

### **The Tension**

You care about your colleague AND about the participants they're serving. Their judgment about their own capacity may be compromised.

### **Key Questions**

* When does peer concern become intervention?  
* What structures exist for addressing facilitator impairment?  
* How do you balance care for colleague with care for community?

| FACILITATOR ANALYSIS This is among the hardest situations—peer accountability for someone you care about. Start with care: 'I'm worried about you. I've heard some feedback about recent sessions, and I've noticed you seem different. How are you really doing?' Be direct if necessary: 'I wonder if taking a break from facilitation might give you space to focus on what you're going through. What would it take to lighten your load?' If they refuse and concerns persist: This may need to escalate. What structures exist in the Institute for addressing facilitator concerns? Use them. Frame as protection: 'I'm asking you to step back not as punishment but as care—for you and for the people you serve. I would want someone to do this for me.' Offer support: 'What do you need? How can I help?' The goal is restoration, not exclusion. |

# **Using This Case Bank**

These 24 cases represent the range of ethical situations Threads practitioners encounter. They are not exhaustive—every practice generates new ethical challenges.

## **Principles for Case Discussion**

* There's rarely one right answer. Most cases involve genuine tensions between competing goods.  
* The goal is developing ethical reasoning, not memorizing correct responses.  
* Your own reactions to cases are data. What activates you reveals your own patterns.  
* Context matters enormously. The same situation in different contexts may require different responses.  
* When in doubt, consult. Supervision exists for exactly these situations.

## **Contributing New Cases**

The ethics case bank grows through practitioner experience. If you encounter a situation that taught you something important, consider contributing it (appropriately anonymized) to future versions of this resource.
