# **THREADS OF BECOMING**

## Clinical Integration & Ethics Guide

For Licensed Mental Health Professionals

The Creative Advance Institute

# **Introduction: Enhancement, Not Replacement**

This guide addresses a question every responsible clinician asks when encountering a new framework: *Is this within my scope of practice?*

The short answer: **Yes**—because Threads of Becoming is not a clinical intervention. It is a **diagnostic and conceptual lens** that enhances the clinical modalities you already practice.

Think of Threads the way you might think of attachment theory or polyvagal theory: a framework that helps you understand what's happening beneath the surface, organize your clinical observations, and make better decisions about intervention. You don't need special licensure to use attachment theory. You need clinical training to know what to *do* with your attachment-informed observations.

The same principle applies here. Threads certification indicates mastery of the framework—not clinical licensure. Your existing license governs what interventions you may provide. Threads simply gives you a more precise diagnostic vocabulary for the universal tensions that underlie so much human suffering and stuckness.

## **What Threads Provides**

* **Diagnostic precision:** Quickly identify which existential tension is activated when clients present with 'stuckness'  
* **Collapse recognition:** See patterns of protective rigidity that may be invisible within single-modality frameworks  
* **Integration language:** Give clients accessible vocabulary for complex internal experiences  
* **Treatment planning clarity:** Know which modality to apply and when, based on which thread is active  
* **Emergence tracking:** Recognize genuine integration versus intellectual insight

## **What Threads Does Not Provide**

* Clinical licensure or expanded scope of practice  
* Permission to diagnose or treat mental health conditions  
* A replacement for evidence-based clinical interventions  
* Training in trauma processing, EMDR, or other specialized protocols  
* Authority to work outside your existing competencies

# **Integration with Clinical Modalities**

Threads of Becoming integrates naturally with evidence-based clinical approaches. Below we map specific connections, showing how the seven threads illuminate dynamics you already work with—and how your existing modalities address the patterns Threads helps you see.

## **Internal Family Systems (IFS)**

**Core alignment:** IFS and Threads share a fundamental stance—curiosity rather than pathology, both/and rather than either/or. The Self energy that IFS cultivates mirrors the 'holding' stance Threads describes. Both frameworks trust that wisdom emerges when we stop trying to fix.

| Thread | IFS Translation | Clinical Application |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| PRESENCE | Parts polarized around connection vs. protection | Identify protectors guarding against intimacy; work with exiles carrying attachment wounds |
| CONSENT | Managers enforcing rigid boundaries; firefighters with no boundaries | Unblend from extreme protectors to access Self-led boundary setting |
| MEMORY | Exiles frozen in past narrative; parts that reject all history | Witness and unburden exiles; help system integrate past without being possessed by it |
| EMBODIMENT | Parts that intellectualize (managers) vs. parts that flood (firefighters/exiles) | Build somatic Self-energy; titrate approach to exiles; expand window of tolerance |
| BECOMING | Parts identified with old roles; legacy burdens blocking new identity | Help parts release outdated roles; create space for new self-conceptions from Self |

**Clinical workflow:**

* Use Threads to identify which existential tension is presenting  
* Use IFS to work with the parts polarized around that tension  
* Track emergence as unburdening allows the system to hold both poles

## **Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)**

**Core alignment:** EFT's attachment focus maps directly to the PRESENCE thread. The pursue-withdraw cycle EFT identifies is a perfect example of partners collapsed toward opposite poles. Softening events represent emergence from held tension.

| EFT Concept | Threads Translation | Integration Point |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Pursue-withdraw cycle | PRESENCE collapse: one partner in Between, one in Within | Name the shared thread; help each access wisdom in partner's pole |
| Attachment injury | MEMORY thread: frozen narrative about partner/relationship | Work with Given (what happened) and Chosen (story we tell now) |
| Softening event | Emergence: something new arising from held tension | Threads explains why softening happens and how to create conditions |

**Clinical workflow:**

* Map the couple's negative cycle to threads (often PRESENCE, CONSENT, or MEMORY)  
* Help each partner see they're collapsed toward opposite poles of the same tension  
* Use EFT techniques to access primary emotions; track emergence as softening occurs

## **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)**

**Core alignment:** ACT's hexaflex maps remarkably onto Threads. Cognitive defusion is MEMORY thread movement. Present-moment awareness is PRESENCE. Acceptance is EMBODIMENT. Values clarification is BECOMING. Threads extends ACT into relational and systemic domains.

| ACT Process | Thread Connection | Threads Enhancement |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Cognitive defusion | MEMORY: from Told (fused) to Telling (authoring) | Identify narrative patterns; honor what the story protected |
| Present moment | PRESENCE: cultivating Within; PAUSE: accessing Now | Distinguish grounded presence from reactive immediacy |
| Acceptance | EMBODIMENT: room for Feel without flooding/dissociating | Track window of tolerance; honor Think pole's protective function |
| Values | BECOMING: Same (what endures) and Different (who I'm becoming) | Distinguish core values from inherited 'shoulds' (MEMORY) |

**Clinical workflow:**

* Use Threads to diagnose which flexibility process is stuck  
* Apply ACT techniques for that specific inflexibility pattern  
* Extend into relational/systemic dimensions that ACT's individual focus may miss

## **Somatic & Trauma-Informed Approaches**

**Core alignment:** The EMBODIMENT thread is explicitly somatic—the tension between Think and Feel. Collapse in this thread mirrors dysregulation patterns. The window of tolerance concept maps directly to capacity to hold both poles.

**Integration with Somatic Experiencing, Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, EMDR:**

* **Dissociation:** EMBODIMENT collapse into Think—protective distance from overwhelming sensation  
* **Flooding:** EMBODIMENT collapse into Feel—overwhelmed without cognitive container  
* **Integration:** Dual awareness (both poles held) IS the goal of trauma processing  
* **Pendulation:** Titrated movement between poles to expand capacity  
* **Resource installation:** Building container that allows tension to be held without collapse

**Important clinical note:** Threads is NOT a trauma processing protocol. Use Threads to identify when EMBODIMENT is active and trauma work is indicated, then apply your trauma-specific training.

# **Scope of Practice Guidelines**

The following guidelines clarify how Threads certification relates to your existing clinical license.

## **What Threads Certification Authorizes**

* Using the seven-thread diagnostic framework to organize clinical observations  
* Teaching clients the Threads vocabulary as a psychoeducational tool  
* Facilitating Navigation Conversations within your existing scope  
* Using collapse/emergence language to track treatment progress  
* Applying seed questions as assessment and exploration tools  
* Integrating Threads insights with your primary clinical modality

## **What Remains Governed by Your License**

* Diagnosing mental health conditions (DSM/ICD)  
* Providing psychotherapy or counseling  
* Treating trauma, personality disorders, or severe mental illness  
* Making clinical decisions about medication, hospitalization, or safety  
* All other activities requiring professional licensure

## **When to Refer**

Even within your licensed scope, some situations require referral to specialists:

* **Active mental health crisis:** Suicidality, psychosis, severe dissociation, active substance crisis  
* **Safety concerns:** Abuse, domestic violence, child welfare issues, duty-to-warn situations  
* **Beyond your competence:** Specialized conditions without specific training  
* **Your own activation:** When your personal material interferes with clinical effectiveness  
* **Dual relationship concerns:** When boundaries cannot be maintained  
* **Medical concerns:** When symptoms may have organic basis requiring medical evaluation

# **Ethical Framework for Clinical Application**

The following ethical commitments supplement—not replace—your licensing board's ethical codes.

## **Core Ethical Commitments**

1. **Hold, Don't Fix**  
   Resist the therapeutic temptation to resolve tension prematurely. Trust that emergence happens when we hold space rather than engineer outcomes.

2. **Honor Both Poles**  
   Never advocate for one pole over another. Both carry essential truth. If you find yourself thinking one pole is 'healthier,' check your own collapse.

3. **Respect Autonomy**  
   The CONSENT thread applies to the therapeutic relationship itself. Offer the framework; don't impose it.

4. **Know Your Scope**  
   Threads certification does not expand your clinical scope. It provides a diagnostic tool to use within your existing competencies.

5. **Manage Your Own Activation**  
   Your own threads will activate in clinical work. Be aware when your material is influencing the work. Seek supervision.

6. **Maintain Confidentiality**  
   Standard clinical confidentiality applies. Exceptions: imminent danger, abuse, court order, and consultation with appropriate anonymization.

7. **Navigate Power Responsibly**  
   The therapeutic relationship involves inherent power dynamics. Frame observations as curiosity, not diagnosis. Invite exploration, not compliance.

# **Documentation Guidelines**

## **Recommended Documentation Practices**

* **Assessment notes:** Document threads as part of case conceptualization  
* **Session notes:** Note thread identification, collapse patterns, emergence indicators  
* **Treatment planning:** Frame goals in terms of expanding capacity to hold both poles  
* **Progress notes:** Track movement from collapse toward emergence  
* **Supervision records:** Document consultation including practitioner's own thread activation

## **Sample Documentation Language**

*Assessment example:*

"Client identified tension between connection needs (Between) and need for solitude (Within). Currently collapsed toward Within with limited access to relational needs. Treatment focus: gradual expansion of capacity to hold both poles through EFT-informed attachment work."

*Progress note example:*

"Session focused on EMBODIMENT thread. Client initially in Think pole (intellectualizing). Using grounding techniques, accessed Feel pole at low intensity without dissociation. Emergence indicator: spontaneous statement 'I can see why I had to shut down—and also feel how much it cost me.'"

# **Clinical Red Flags & Contraindications**

While Threads is broadly applicable, certain situations require caution or modification:

1. **Active trauma symptoms**  
   When clients are acutely distressed, stabilize first. Introduce Threads once window of tolerance has expanded.

2. **Personality organization with splitting**  
   Clients with borderline/narcissistic features may struggle with 'both/and' thinking. Build alliance and mentalization first.

3. **Psychotic processes**  
   Do not introduce abstract frameworks to clients experiencing active psychosis. 'Tension' and 'emergence' language could be incorporated into delusional material.

4. **Severe dissociation**  
   EMBODIMENT work may be contraindicated until clients have sufficient grounding resources. Partner with trauma specialist if outside your training.

5. **Intellectual defensiveness**  
   If a client becomes expert at analyzing threads while remaining defended, the framework is being used for collapse (into Think). Name this pattern compassionately.

6. **Couples with active abuse**  
   In IPV situations, 'honoring both poles' could minimize harm. Safety always comes first. Threads work requires genuine partnership, not power-over dynamics.

# **Quick Reference: Threads & Clinical Presentations**

| Thread | Common Presentations | DSM/Clinical Correlates |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

| **CONSENT** Yes / No | Boundary issues, people-pleasing, rigidity, power struggles, inability to say no | Passive-aggressive, oppositional features, trauma responses to violation |
| **MEMORY** Given / Chosen | Stuck in past, denial of history, rigid narratives, identity confusion, rootlessness | PTSD/C-PTSD, grief disorders, identity disturbance, dissociative amnesia |
| **PAUSE** Not Yet / Now | Procrastination, impulsivity, decision paralysis, compulsive action, analysis paralysis | ADHD patterns, OCD, anxiety-driven avoidance, impulse control issues |
| **EMBODIMENT** Think / Feel | Intellectualization, emotional flooding, dissociation, somatic symptoms, alexithymia | Somatic symptom disorders, dissociative disorders, emotion dysregulation |
| **UNCERTAINTY** Hide / Seek | Chronic worry, reckless risk-taking, need for certainty, catastrophizing, naive optimism | Generalized anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, mania features, risk-taking |
| **BECOMING** Same / Different | Identity confusion, rigid self-concept, impostor syndrome, chronic reinvention, midlife crisis | Identity disturbance, adjustment disorders, developmental transitions |

# **Conclusion: A Lens, Not a License**

Threads of Becoming offers clinicians a unified diagnostic vocabulary for the existential tensions underlying human suffering. Clients speak the language of symptoms—anxiety, depression, relationship problems. Threads helps you hear the deeper pattern.

But a diagnostic lens is not an intervention protocol. Your clinical training tells you what to do once you see the pattern. Threads helps you see it.

This means you can integrate Threads immediately without scope creep. You're not adding a treatment modality—you're adding a conceptual tool that makes your existing modalities more precise.

The seven threads are not new truths. They name tensions you already work with. What Threads provides is the *map*—a way of organizing observations that helps you navigate with greater confidence.

Your clients are already navigating these tensions. Threads gives you—and them—a shared language for the journey.
