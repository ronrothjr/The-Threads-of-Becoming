| THREADS OF BECOMING For Clergy *Pastoral Tension Navigation* Ministers • Chaplains • Spiritual Directors • Congregational Leaders |
| :---: |

## **The Challenge You Know**

You sit with people in their deepest struggles—grief and hope, doubt and faith, individual need and community obligation. You navigate congregations torn between tradition and change. You hold space for discernment when the path forward is unclear.

You already know that most pastoral situations aren't problems to solve but tensions to hold. The Threads of Becoming framework gives you a shared language and diagnostic tools for what you've been doing intuitively.

| Core Insight: *Tension, held without collapse, becomes the birthplace of the genuinely new.* |
| :---: |

## **Why This Framework Fits Pastoral Work**

### **Theologically Grounded**

Threads is rooted in Process Philosophy (Whitehead), which has deep resonance with progressive theological traditions. The framework honors mystery, emergence, and the creative advance into novelty—language that will feel familiar. It works across theological boundaries because it addresses universal human tensions rather than doctrinal positions.

### **Already Aligned with Pastoral Intuition**

Good pastoral care doesn't rush to fix. It holds space. It honors the "not yet." It trusts that something new can emerge when people are truly heard. Threads gives names to what you already do—and tools for doing it more skillfully.

### **Applicable at Multiple Scales**

The same framework applies to one-on-one pastoral conversations, couples in crisis, committee conflicts, and congregation-wide discernment. You don't need different tools for different contexts—just different applications of the same diagnostic structure.

| KEY APPLICATIONS FOR CLERGY • Pastoral Conversations: Use the Threadwork protocol for one-on-one care • Couples & Families: Help partners see how they've collapsed toward opposite poles • Congregational Conflict: Diagnose which thread is activated; name both sides' legitimate concerns • Discernment Circles: Use seed questions as prompts for group reflection • Sermon & Teaching: The seven threads provide rich material for preaching series • Committee Work: When meetings get stuck, identify the underlying tension  |
| :---- |

## **Threads Most Relevant to Pastoral Ministry**

* MEMORY (Given ↔ Chosen): Tradition vs. innovation in worship, theology, practice

* PRESENCE (Within ↔ Between): Individual spiritual life vs. community belonging

* CONSENT (Yes ↔ No): Boundaries in pastoral relationships; congregational autonomy

* UNCERTAINTY (Hide ↔ Seek): Faith and doubt; discernment when the way is unclear

* BECOMING (Same ↔ Different): Identity transformation in life transitions

## **A Pastoral Example**

A congregant comes to you torn between caring for aging parents (honoring the given) and pursuing a career opportunity that requires relocation (choosing their own path). They feel guilty either way.

Traditional pastoral care might explore feelings, offer empathy, perhaps suggest prayer or discernment practices. Threads adds a diagnostic layer: This is the MEMORY thread—the tension between Given and Chosen. The congregant has collapsed toward one pole (probably 'Given' if they feel guilty about the career opportunity). Your role isn't to tell them what to do. It's to help them access the wisdom of both poles—honoring what they've received AND authoring their own story—and to trust that something new can emerge when both are held.

| THREADS OF BECOMING For Therapists *Clinical Integration* Psychotherapists • Counselors • Clinical Social Workers • Marriage & Family Therapists |
| :---: |

## **The Challenge You Know**

You work with clients who are stuck—caught in patterns they can't seem to escape. They oscillate between extremes, or they're frozen, unable to move in any direction. You have powerful modalities (IFS, EFT, ACT, DBT, and others), but sometimes you need a different lens.

Threads of Becoming isn't a replacement for clinical training. It's a meta-language that enhances what you already do—a diagnostic overlay that helps you see the structure of stuckness and the pathway toward integration.

| Core Insight: *Tension, held without collapse, becomes the birthplace of the genuinely new.* |
| :---: |

## **Integration with Clinical Modalities**

### **With Internal Family Systems (IFS)**

Parts holding extreme positions are experiencing collapse toward one pole. The Self-energy you cultivate as a therapist mirrors the facilitator stance in Threads: curious, compassionate, not trying to fix. Threads can serve as a triage layer—identify the activated thread, then use IFS techniques for parts work within that tension.

### **With Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)**

The pursue-withdraw cycle is a collapse pattern in the PRESENCE thread (Between vs. Within). Attachment injuries live in the MEMORY thread. Softening events are emergence from held creative tension. Threads gives you language for the underlying polarity structure that EFT addresses through attachment.

### **With Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT)**

Cognitive defusion is movement in the MEMORY thread (from 'Told' to 'Telling'). Present-moment awareness is the PRESENCE thread. Acceptance is the EMBODIMENT thread. Values clarification is BECOMING. Threads provides a relational and systemic extension of ACT's individual focus.

| KEY APPLICATIONS FOR THERAPISTS • Diagnostic Clarity: Quickly identify which existential tension is activated • Collapse Recognition: See where clients are stuck in one pole; understand the protective function • Emergence Support: Recognize when genuine shift is happening vs. intellectual insight • Couples Work: Map pursue-withdraw and other patterns to specific threads • Trauma Integration: EMBODIMENT thread specifically addresses dissociation/flooding spectrum • Treatment Planning: Use threads to identify which tensions need attention in what order  |
| :---- |

## **A Clinical Example**

A trauma survivor presents with oscillation between emotional numbing (dissociation) and overwhelming affect (flooding). Standard trauma treatment addresses this through titration and window of tolerance expansion.

Threads adds: This is the EMBODIMENT thread—the tension between Think and Feel. Both poles carry wisdom. Dissociation protects; feeling connects to aliveness. The client has lost access to the middle—they can only be in one pole at a time. Your work is to help them develop dual awareness: thinking AND feeling simultaneously, starting at low intensity. Collapse is not failure; it's information about where the system needs support.

## **Scope Clarification**

Threads is not a clinical modality and does not replace clinical training. It is a conceptual framework that enhances clinical work. Use within your existing scope of practice and ethical guidelines. Threads certification indicates framework mastery, not clinical licensure.

| THREADS OF BECOMING For Coaches *Leadership & Life Transitions* Executive Coaches • Life Coaches • Leadership Developers • Mentors |
| :---: |

## **The Challenge You Know**

Your clients are often high-functioning people facing transitions: new roles, career pivots, leadership challenges, life stage shifts. They're not broken—they're navigating complexity. They need frameworks that honor their capability while helping them see what they can't see on their own.

Threads of Becoming gives you a diagnostic structure for the tensions your clients face—and a 20-minute conversation protocol that creates movement without requiring long-term engagement.

| Core Insight: *Tension, held without collapse, becomes the birthplace of the genuinely new.* |
| :---: |

## **Why This Framework Fits Coaching**

### **Growth-Oriented, Not Pathology-Focused**

Threads doesn't assume something is wrong. It assumes something is stuck. The framework honors both sides of every tension and trusts that clients have the wisdom to navigate when they can see clearly. This aligns with coaching's strengths-based orientation.

### **Action-Ready**

Threadwork is a 20-minute protocol with clear phases: Arrive, Name, Hold, Integrate. It produces movement in a single session. Clients leave with insight AND next steps. This fits the action-orientation of coaching engagements.

### **Works Across Contexts**

The same seven threads appear in career decisions, leadership challenges, relationship dynamics, and life transitions. You don't need different tools for different presenting issues—just diagnostic accuracy about which thread is activated.

| KEY APPLICATIONS FOR COACHES • Career Transitions: BECOMING thread (Same ↔ Different) for identity shifts • Leadership Presence: PRESENCE thread (Within ↔ Between) for executive presence work • Decision Paralysis: PAUSE thread (Not Yet ↔ Now) for timing discernment • Stakeholder Navigation: CONSENT thread (Yes ↔ No) for boundary setting • Strategic Thinking: UNCERTAINTY thread (Hide ↔ Seek) for navigating ambiguity • Legacy & Values: MEMORY thread (Given ↔ Chosen) for values clarification  |
| :---- |

## **A Coaching Example**

A senior leader is offered a C-suite role. She's excited AND terrified. She keeps cycling between "I'm ready for this" and "Who am I to think I can do this?" She's paralyzed, and the deadline is approaching.

Standard coaching might explore values, examine limiting beliefs, or push toward action. Threads adds: This is the BECOMING thread—the tension between Same and Different. She's oscillating between collapse into Same ("I'm not ready") and collapse into Different (idealized fantasies of the new role). Neither pole is the answer. Your work is to help her hold both: she IS who she's been AND she's becoming someone new. From that held tension, a third thing can emerge—perhaps a 90-day transition experiment that reduces the existential stakes while allowing real movement.

## **The 20-Minute Threadwork**

The signature Threads protocol fits naturally into coaching sessions:

1. ARRIVE (2-3 min): Ground yourself and the client. "What's alive for you right now?"

2. NAME (4-6 min): Identify the activated thread. Name both poles. Check for collapse.

3. HOLD (8-12 min): Validate both poles. Use diagnostic questions. Watch for emergence.

4. INTEGRATE (3-4 min): "What's different now?" Identify smallest next step.

| THREADS OF BECOMING For Mediators *Conflict Transformation* Mediators • Conflict Resolution Specialists • Group Facilitators • Restorative Practitioners |
| :---: |

## **The Challenge You Know**

You work in the space between parties who see themselves as adversaries. You know that beneath positions are interests, and beneath interests are needs. You've learned that the path forward often requires something neither party initially imagined.

Threads of Becoming offers a diagnostic layer for understanding why parties are stuck—and a framework that reframes conflict as creative tension waiting to be held rather than a problem waiting to be solved.

| Core Insight: *Tension, held without collapse, becomes the birthplace of the genuinely new.* |
| :---: |

## **Why This Framework Fits Mediation**

### **Beyond Positions AND Interests**

Interest-based negotiation taught us to look beneath positions. Threads goes further: beneath interests are universal tensions that every human navigates. When parties understand they're caught in the same thread (just collapsed toward opposite poles), the dynamic shifts from adversarial to collaborative.

### **A Third Way That's Not Compromise**

Compromise splits the difference. Creative tension held without collapse produces emergence—something genuinely new that neither party could have imagined alone. This is what transformative mediation aims for. Threads gives it a structure.

### **Diagnostic Precision**

When mediation stalls, it helps to know why. The seven threads provide diagnostic categories: Is this about PRESENCE (who's at the table)? CONSENT (who decides)? MEMORY (what happened)? PAUSE (timing)? Accurate diagnosis enables targeted intervention.

| KEY APPLICATIONS FOR MEDIATORS • Impasse Breaking: Identify which thread is activated; name both poles; reframe as shared challenge • Pre-Mediation: Use seed questions to understand each party's position within a thread • Caucus Work: Help parties see their own collapse and access the other pole's wisdom • Agreement Sustainability: Ensure agreements honor both poles rather than forcing one party's collapse • Restorative Circles: Use seven seed questions as prompts for healing circles • Facilitation: When groups are stuck, diagnose the thread and use appropriate interventions  |
| :---- |

## **A Mediation Example**

Two business partners are in dispute. One wants to expand aggressively ("We have to move now or we'll miss the market"). The other wants to consolidate ("We're not ready—we need to stabilize first"). Traditional mediation might seek compromise: partial expansion, phased approach.

Threads adds: This is the PAUSE thread—the tension between Now and Not Yet. Both poles carry wisdom. The "Now" partner sees real market opportunity. The "Not Yet" partner sees real operational risk. They've each collapsed toward one pole and can only see the other as obstructing. Your work is to help them hold both: What is genuinely ready to move now? What genuinely needs more time? From that held tension, a third option might emerge—perhaps a specific initiative that can launch immediately while other areas stabilize.

## **Integration with Restorative Practices**

Restorative circles already embody much of the Threads philosophy: creating space, honoring all voices, trusting emergence. The seven seed questions can be used as circle prompts. When circles get stuck, Threads provides diagnostic tools to identify which tension is activated and what might help it move.

| THREADS OF BECOMING For Leaders *Organizational Tension Navigation* Executives • Team Leaders • OD Consultants • HR Business Partners |
| :---: |

## **The Challenge You Know**

You lead in environments of constant tension: innovation vs. execution, growth vs. sustainability, speed vs. quality, centralization vs. autonomy. You've learned that these aren't problems to solve but polarities to manage. Yet your teams often get stuck—paralyzed by analysis, reactive to pressure, or locked in unproductive conflict.

Threads of Becoming provides a framework for navigating organizational polarities with diagnostic precision. It helps you see why teams are stuck and gives you language to move them forward.

| Core Insight: *Tension, held without collapse, becomes the birthplace of the genuinely new.* |
| :---: |

## **Why This Framework Fits Organizational Leadership**

### **Complements Polarity Management**

If you've used Barry Johnson's Polarity Management or similar frameworks, Threads will feel familiar. The difference: Threads provides a defined taxonomy of seven universal tensions rather than requiring you to identify custom polarities each time. This accelerates diagnosis and builds shared organizational language.

### **Works at Individual, Team, and System Levels**

The same seven threads appear in individual coaching conversations, team dynamics, and organizational strategy. A leader stuck in PAUSE (Now vs. Not Yet) creates a team culture that reflects that collapse. Systemic diagnosis enables systemic intervention.

### **Actionable in Real Time**

Threadwork protocol can be used in a 20-minute one-on-one, a team meeting that's gone sideways, or a strategic planning session. You don't need to stop everything for a workshop—you can apply the framework in the flow of work.

| KEY APPLICATIONS FOR ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERS • Strategic Planning: Identify which organizational tensions are driving strategic debates • Team Dysfunction: Diagnose collapse patterns; help teams access both poles • Decision Paralysis: PAUSE and UNCERTAINTY threads for stuck decisions • Change Management: MEMORY thread (Given ↔ Chosen) for navigating tradition vs. innovation • Executive Coaching: BECOMING thread for leaders in role transitions • Conflict Resolution: Name the underlying thread to shift from adversarial to collaborative  |
| :---- |

## **Common Organizational Tensions by Thread**

| Thread | Organizational Manifestations |
| :---- | :---- |
| **PRESENCE** | Individual contributor ↔ Team player; Autonomy ↔ Collaboration; Remote ↔ In-person |
| **CONSENT** | Centralized ↔ Decentralized; Top-down ↔ Bottom-up; Control ↔ Empowerment |
| **MEMORY** | Legacy systems ↔ New technology; "How we've always done it" ↔ Innovation; Culture ↔ Disruption |
| **PAUSE** | Planning ↔ Execution; Analysis ↔ Action; Strategy ↔ Tactics; R\&D ↔ Operations |
| **EMBODIMENT** | Data-driven ↔ Intuition; Metrics ↔ Culture; Head ↔ Heart in leadership |
| **UNCERTAINTY** | Risk management ↔ Innovation; Known markets ↔ New ventures; Stability ↔ Agility |
| **BECOMING** | Core competency ↔ Diversification; Who we are ↔ Who we're becoming; Purpose ↔ Pivot |

## **An Organizational Example**

Your leadership team is stuck on a strategic decision. Half want to expand into a new market now ("We'll lose the window\!"). Half want to wait until the core business is more stable ("We're not ready\!"). Every meeting ends in frustration. Both sides think the other is being irresponsible.

Traditional approaches might seek compromise or push for a decision. Threads adds: This is the PAUSE thread—Now vs. Not Yet. Both sides carry organizational wisdom. The "Now" faction sees real market opportunity; the "Not Yet" faction sees real operational risk. They've collapsed toward opposite poles and can only see each other as adversaries. Your intervention: Name the thread. Validate both poles publicly. Ask: "What is genuinely ready to move now? What genuinely needs more time?" From that held tension, a third option often emerges—perhaps a targeted pilot that captures opportunity while limiting exposure.

# **Appendix: The Seven Threads**

All five field-specific applications draw on the same underlying framework. Here is a summary of all seven threads for quick reference.

| Thread | Seed Question | Pole ↔ Pole | Collapse Signs |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **PRESENCE** | *Where am I…?* | Within ↔ BetweenHere ↔ Elsewhere | Isolation / Enmeshment |
| **CONSENT** | *What may I…?* | Yes ↔ NoSelf ↔ Other | Boundaryless / Rigid |
| **MEMORY** | *Why do I…?* | Given ↔ ChosenTelling ↔ Told | Possessed / Rootless |
| **PAUSE** | *When can I…?* | Not Yet ↔ NowMore ↔ Enough | Paralysis / Reactivity |
| **EMBODIMENT** | *How does my body know?* | Think ↔ FeelStay ↔ Go | Dissociation / Flooding |
| **UNCERTAINTY** | *What is the mystery unveiling?* | Hide ↔ SeekThreat ↔ Wonder | Paralyzed / Reckless |
| **BECOMING** | *Who am I becoming now?* | Same ↔ DifferentReturn ↔ Forward | Stuck / Unmoored |

## **The Session Arc**

| ARRIVE 2-3 min | NAME 4-6 min | HOLD 8-12 min | INTEGRATE 3-4 min |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Ground yourself and client. "What's alive for you?" | Identify thread. Name both poles. Check for collapse. | Validate both. Use diagnostic Qs. Watch for emergence. | "What's different?" Smallest next step. Close. |
