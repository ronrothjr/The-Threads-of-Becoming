# Local Threads Chapters

## Living out Community of Practice in Your Neighborhood

Local Threads Chapters are community-based groups led by Creative Advance Institute (CAI) trained facilitators who gather regularly to practice the Threads framework and offer services to their neighborhoods, congregations, and organizations.

Chapters embody the **Community of Practice principles**: they're spaces where people learn together by navigating real tensions, hold each other accountable to the framework's ethics, and extend Threadwork beyond individual practice into collective transformation.

This isn't about creating new organizations—it's about weaving Threads into existing community life through people committed to holding tension without collapse.

## What Local Chapters Do

Chapters operate at the intersection of practice and service:

### 1. Monthly Gatherings
Members practice holding tension together through real community issues, supporting each other's navigation of collapse, and deepening collective understanding of the threads.

### 2. Free Community Workshops
Monthly "Holding Tension" workshops open to the public, using themed packets provided by CAI. These introduce Threads to neighbors navigating marriage, parenting, work, faith, and civic life.

### 3. Organizational Facilitation
Chapters offer facilitation services to local congregations, nonprofits, schools, and businesses navigating difficult tensions—not as consultants, but as trained practitioners who can hold space.

### 4. Study & Discovery
Working through the Thread Discovery Process together, testing emerging threads across difference, and contributing insights back to the broader Threads community.

### 5. Specialized Groups
Threads for Parents groups in schools, couples' circles, professional peer groups (therapists, coaches, clergy, educators), school-based teacher cohorts, and affinity spaces where the framework meets specific contexts.

### 6. Cross-Pollination
Collaborating with existing community groups—faith communities, mediation centers, civic organizations—to integrate Threads where it serves rather than replaces local wisdom.

## Chapter Leadership Requirements

**All chapter leaders must be CAI-trained facilitators.** This isn't about gatekeeping—it's about ensuring that people offering Threadwork in communities have been properly trained in the framework's ethics, boundaries, and application.

### Training Pathway

**Tier 2: Facilitator Training (Minimum Requirement)**
Tier 2 training equips facilitators to hold space for groups, navigate collapse, and apply Threads in relational and organizational contexts. This is the minimum certification required to lead a local chapter.

**Tier 3: Advanced Practitioner (Optional)**
For chapters taking on organizational consulting or training other facilitators, Tier 3 certification provides advanced skills in systemic work, multi-party facilitation, and collective discernment.

### Leadership Ethics
Chapter leaders commit to:
- Never using the framework to manipulate, control, or exploit vulnerability
- Recognizing when work exceeds their scope and referring appropriately
- Maintaining supervision and peer consultation relationships
- Practicing transparency about the framework's limits
- Contributing back to the broader Threads community

## How to Start a Local Chapter

### 1. Complete CAI Training
At minimum, one chapter leader must complete Tier 2 certification. Ideally, 2-3 co-leaders share facilitation responsibilities.

### 2. Identify Your Context
Consider:
- What community are you serving? (Geographic neighborhood, professional network, faith community, etc.)
- What tensions are alive in this context?
- What existing groups or institutions might partner with you?
- Who else might be interested in co-leading?

### 3. Submit a Chapter Proposal
Write a brief (2-3 page) proposal including:
- Your training background and facilitator team
- The community context and need
- Initial vision for gatherings and services
- How you'll sustain the work (time, space, relationships)
- Any partnerships or organizational support

### 4. Complete Chapter Orientation
CAI provides a 2-hour orientation covering:
- Chapter structure and expectations
- How to use monthly packets
- Consultation and supervision protocols
- Ethical boundaries and referral networks
- Connection to the broader Threads community

### 5. Launch with a Pilot Series
Begin with 3 monthly workshops using CAI packets. Learn what works in your context before expanding services or making long-term commitments.

### 6. Stay Connected
Participate in quarterly chapter network calls, share learnings, and reach out for consultation when tensions arise. Chapters thrive through connection.
