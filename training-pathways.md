Version 1.0 — 2024

# **Training Pathway Overview**

The Threads of Becoming training pathway is designed to develop practitioners who can skillfully navigate creative tension in any relational context—couples, teams, congregations, organizations, or therapeutic settings.

The pathway is structured in three tiers, each building on the previous:

| Tier | Focus | Audience | Outcome |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1: Foundations** | Understanding the framework | Anyone seeking personal growth or professional introduction | Certificate of Completion |
| **2: Practitioner** | Applying with individuals & dyads | Coaches, clergy, therapists, mediators | Certified Threads Practitioner |
| **3: Facilitator** | Leading groups & systems | Organizational consultants, senior clergy, team leaders | Certified Threads Facilitator |

## **Guiding Principles**

1. Embodied Learning: Knowledge must move from concept to muscle memory. Every session includes practice.

2. Spiral Development: Participants revisit core concepts at increasing depth across tiers.

3. Supervised Application: Real-world practice with feedback is essential for skill development.

4. Community of Practice: Learning happens best in cohorts where practitioners support each other.

5. Ethical Grounding: The framework is powerful; practitioners must develop judgment about when and how to use it.

## **Progression Requirements**

| To Enter | Foundations | Practitioner | Facilitator |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Prerequisites** | None | Foundations certificate \+ professional role | Practitioner certification \+ 1 year practice |
| **Time Investment** | 4 hours (1 day) | 16 hours (4 weeks) \+ 6 supervision hours | 24 hours (6 weeks) \+ 20-hour practicum |
| **Assessment** | Attendance \+ self-reflection | Observed session \+ written case study | Live group facilitation \+ practicum portfolio |

| TIER 1 Foundations *Understanding the Framework* |
| :---: |

| AT A GLANCE Duration: 4 hours (half-day workshop or two 2-hour sessions) Format: In-person or virtual; cohort size 8-24 Prerequisites: None Outcome: Certificate of Completion in Threads Foundations  |
| :---- |

## **Purpose**

Tier 1 provides a complete introduction to the Threads of Becoming framework. Participants leave with conceptual understanding, personal insight into their own tension patterns, and the ability to recognize threads in everyday situations.

This tier serves two populations:

* Individuals seeking personal growth and self-understanding

* Professionals exploring whether to pursue practitioner certification

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of Tier 1, participants will be able to:

1. Explain the core premise: tension held without collapse becomes the birthplace of the genuinely new.

2. Name and describe all seven threads and their seed questions.

3. Identify the two poles within each thread and articulate why both carry truth.

4. Recognize collapse dynamics—how individuals and systems get stuck in one pole.

5. Apply the Thread Discovery Process to their own life situation.

6. Distinguish between spiral and circular patterns in recurring conflicts.

## **Curriculum**

* Complete all four training modules

* Complete all three supervision sessions

* Submit one recorded Threadwork session for assessment

* Submit one written case study (2-3 pages) demonstrating framework application

* Pass competency assessment (see rubric below)

* Sign the Practitioner Ethics Agreement

## **Competency Assessment Rubric**

| Competency | Meets Standard | Does Not Yet Meet |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Protocol Fidelity | Follows 4-phase arc; uses appropriate scripts; maintains timing | Skips phases; uses scripts rigidly or not at all; loses structure |
| Diagnostic Accuracy | Correctly identifies primary thread; articulates both poles | Misidentifies thread; conflates poles; imposes rather than discovers |
| Collapse Correction | Recognizes collapse; applies gentle redirect; honors unchosen pole | Misses collapse; corrects harshly; joins the collapse |
| Emergence Support | Notices emergence signs; supports without forcing; honors partial shifts | Misses emergence; forces resolution; overreaches on outcomes |
| Facilitator Presence | Stays grounded; holds space; doesn't try to fix; manages own activation | Gets activated; tries to solve; loses neutrality; projects own tensions |

Candidates must "Meet Standard" on all five competencies to receive certification. Those who do not yet meet standard in one or two areas may resubmit after additional practice and supervision.

# **Ethics & Scope of Practice**

All Threads practitioners and facilitators commit to the following ethical principles:

## **Core Ethical Commitments**

### **1\. Hold, Don't Fix**

The practitioner's role is to help people hold creative tension, not to solve their problems. We resist the temptation to impose solutions, predict outcomes, or push toward resolution. Emergence cannot be forced.

### **2\. Honor Both Poles**

We never advocate for one pole over another. Both poles carry truth. Our job is to help people access and integrate both—not to convince them which is "right."

### **3\. Respect Autonomy**

We honor each person's sovereignty over their own process. We offer the framework; we do not impose it. Consent is foundational—if someone doesn't want to engage with a thread, we don't push.

### **4\. Know Your Scope**

Threads is a framework for navigating creative tension. It is not therapy, and it is not a substitute for clinical care. Practitioners recognize when a situation exceeds their competence and refer appropriately.

### **5\. Manage Your Own Activation**

Practitioners have their own tensions and collapses. We commit to ongoing self-awareness, supervision, and personal practice. When we are activated, we acknowledge it and take appropriate action.

### **6\. Maintain Confidentiality**

What is shared in Threadwork sessions and group facilitations is confidential. Exceptions: immediate danger, legal requirements, supervision (with appropriate anonymization).

### **7\. Navigate Power Responsibly**

Practitioners are aware of power dynamics in their relationships with clients and in the systems they work with. We do not exploit trust. We name power dynamics when appropriate.

## **Scope of Practice by Tier**

| Certification | Authorized Activities |
| :---- | :---- |
| Foundations Certificate | Personal application; informal sharing with others; NOT professional practice |
| Certified Practitioner | Individual and dyadic Threadwork sessions within professional context; NOT group facilitation, NOT organizational consulting, NOT training others |
| Certified Facilitator | All Practitioner activities PLUS group facilitation, organizational consulting, teaching Tier 1, supervising Tier 2 candidates |

## **When to Refer**

Threads practitioners should refer to other professionals when:

* There is active mental health crisis (suicidal ideation, psychosis, severe depression)

* The situation involves abuse, violence, or immediate safety concerns

* The person needs clinical treatment beyond tension navigation

* The practitioner's own activation is interfering with their effectiveness

* The situation exceeds the practitioner's scope (e.g., Practitioner asked to do group work)

* There is a dual relationship that cannot be appropriately managed

# **Continuing Education & Community of Practice**

## **Certification Maintenance**

To maintain certification, practitioners and facilitators must:

| Requirement | Practitioner (CTP) | Facilitator (CTF) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Continuing Education | 6 hours annually | 10 hours annually |
| Peer Consultation | 4 sessions annually | 6 sessions annually |
| Community of Practice | Recommended | Required |
| Recertification | Every 3 years | Every 3 years |

## **Continuing Education Options**

* Annual Threads Gathering (in-person conference)

* Advanced topic workshops (virtual or in-person)

* Case consultation groups

* Supervision (giving or receiving)

* Publishing or presenting on Threads application

* Cross-training in complementary modalities (IFS, EFT, NVC, etc.)

## **Community of Practice**

The Creative Advance Institute hosts an ongoing community of practice for all certified practitioners and facilitators. This includes:

* Monthly virtual gatherings for case consultation

* Online forum for questions, resources, and peer support

* Annual in-person retreat

* Access to updated materials and new resources

* Opportunities to contribute to framework development

The community of practice is where the framework stays alive—where practitioners learn from each other, where new applications emerge, and where the Threads evolve through collective wisdom.
