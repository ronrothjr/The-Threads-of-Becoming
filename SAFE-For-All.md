# S.A.F.E. For All

**An anti-bullying framework built on Threads of Becoming**

See. Ask. Feel. Emerge.

---

## The Core Insight

Most anti-bullying programs fail because they collapse into the very binary they're trying to solve: good kid/bad kid, victim/bully, safe/unsafe.

**S.A.F.E. works differently.** It teaches everyone—the kid being hurt, the kid doing harm, and the witnesses—how to hold the tension of difficult moments without collapsing into shame, blame, or helplessness.

**When a child learns to be S.A.F.E., they're not learning rules. They're learning who they want to become when things get hard.**

---

## S.A.F.E.: See. Ask. Feel. Emerge.

### S - See What's Happening

**Notice what's happening in your body and around you**

**What this means:**
- Your heart is beating fast
- Your face feels hot
- Someone is saying words that hurt
- Someone is being left out
- Your hands want to push

**Thread Foundation:** PRESENCE (Within / Between) + EMBODIMENT (Body knows)

**For the kid being hurt:**
"I see that I'm being left out. I see that my stomach hurts."

**For the kid doing harm:**
"I see that I'm about to say something mean. I see that I want them to feel small."

**For the witness:**
"I see someone being hurt. I see that I'm scared to help."

**Why this is transformative:**
Most programs tell kids "don't bully" or "tell an adult." S.A.F.E. teaches presence first—noticing what's happening in your body and around you before reacting.

When kids learn to SEE (both internally and externally), they develop **awareness before action**—the foundation of all self-regulation and empathy.

---

### A - Ask About the Tension

**What's the push-pull? What are both sides pulling toward?**

Instead of "Who's the bad guy?" we ask "What tension is alive here?"

**Tension Examples:**

**Exclusion:**
- "I want to belong / I want to be myself"
- "I want my special friends / I know how it feels to be left out"

**Physical aggression:**
- "I'm angry / I don't want to hurt people"
- "I want respect / I don't want to solve this with fists"

**Relational aggression:**
- "I want power / I don't want to be mean"
- "I want them to like me / I can't control what others think"

**For witnesses:**
- "I want to help / I'm scared"
- "I want to fit in / I know this is wrong"

**Thread Foundation:** All seven threads show up in bullying dynamics—PRESENCE, CONSENT, MEMORY, PAUSE, EMBODIMENT, UNCERTAINTY, BECOMING

**Why this is transformative:**
Traditional programs frame conflict as "victim vs. bully." ASK reframes it as tension—two competing needs or values pulling against each other.

When kids learn to ASK about the tension (not assign blame), they develop **complexity thinking**: "Both sides have needs. How do we hold that?"

---

### F - Feel Both Sides

**Can you feel both pulls at the same time? Can both be true?**

This is the hardest step and the most powerful.

**Can you hold opposing truths without one winning?**

**For the kid being hurt:**
- "You deserve to be included AND other kids get to choose their friends. Both true?"
- "You want them to stop AND you can't control what they do. Can you hold both?"
- "You're brave AND you're scared. Both at the same time?"

**For the kid doing harm:**
- "You feel powerful when you're mean AND you don't like who you're being. Both true?"
- "You're angry at them AND anger doesn't mean you get to hurt them. Can you feel both?"
- "You want your friends to think you're tough AND being tough doesn't mean making others small. Both?"

**For the witness:**
- "You want to help AND you're scared of becoming a target. Both real?"
- "You care about your friend being hurt AND you don't want to lose your other friends. Can both matter?"

**Thread Foundation:** HOLD (the core practice of holding tension without collapse)

**Why this is transformative:**
When kids learn to FEEL both sides, they stop collapsing into victim mentality ("I'm helpless"), aggressor mentality ("They deserve it"), or bystander paralysis ("There's nothing I can do").

Instead they develop **agency within complexity**: "This is hard AND I can choose who I want to be."

---

### E - Emerge as Who You Want to Be

**Who do you want to be in this moment? What kind of person are you becoming?**

This isn't "what should you do" (rules). It's "who are you becoming" (identity formation).

**For the kid being hurt:**
- "Do you want to be someone who falls apart when one person is mean? Or someone who can feel hurt AND still have a good day?"
- "Do you want to be someone who needs everyone to like them? Or someone who knows they're valuable even when excluded?"

**For the kid doing harm:**
- "Do you want to be someone who gets power by making others small? Or someone who can feel big without making others feel little?"
- "When you're angry, who do you become? Is that who you want to be?"

**For the witness:**
- "Do you want to be someone who watches others get hurt because you're scared? Or someone who can be scared AND still do the right thing?"

**Thread Foundation:** BECOMING (Who I've been / Who I'm becoming) + UNCERTAINTY (Mystery unveiling)

**Why this is transformative:**
It shifts from external control ("You're in trouble") to internal formation ("You're becoming someone").

The kid learns: **I'm not a victim or a bully. I'm a person learning who I want to become.**

## How S.A.F.E. Creates Safety for Everyone

### For the Kid Being Hurt

**Traditional approach:**
"Tell an adult." "Ignore them." "Stand up for yourself."

**Why it fails:**
Kid learns: I'm helpless and need adults to fix my problems.

**S.A.F.E. approach:**
- **SEE:** "I see I'm being left out and my stomach hurts."
- **ASK:** "What's the tension? I want to belong AND they want their special friends."
- **FEEL:** "Both can be true. I can want to belong AND they can choose."
- **EMERGE:** "I can be someone who feels hurt AND makes a different choice (find new friends, do something I love, ask to join without needing them to say yes)."

**Result:**
Kid learns: I have feelings AND I have choices. I'm not helpless.

---

### For the Kid Doing Harm

**Traditional approach:**
"Stop bullying." Consequences. Punishment. Shame.

**Why it fails:**
Kid learns: I'm a bad person. Authority figures control me through fear.

**S.A.F.E. approach:**
- **SEE:** "I see I want to say something mean to make them feel small."
- **ASK:** "What's the tension? I want to feel powerful AND I don't like who I'm becoming when I'm mean."
- **FEEL:** "Both are true. I can want power AND not hurt others to get it."
- **EMERGE:** "Who do I want to be? Someone who gets power by making others small, or someone who feels strong without that?"

**Result:**
Kid learns: I can choose who I'm becoming. I'm not defined by my worst moment.

---

### For the Witness

**Traditional approach:**
"Be an upstander." "Tell an adult." "Don't let it happen."

**Why it fails:**
Kid learns: If I don't act (and I'm scared to act), I'm a bad person too.

**S.A.F.E. approach:**
- **SEE:** "I see someone being hurt. I see I'm scared to help."
- **ASK:** "What's the tension? I want to help AND I'm scared I'll be next."
- **FEEL:** "Both are real. I can care about them AND be scared."
- **EMERGE:** "Who do I want to be? Someone who stays quiet because of fear, or someone who can be scared AND still try (ask if they're okay, sit with them at lunch, tell a teacher what I saw)?"

**Result:**
Kid learns: Courage isn't the absence of fear. It's choosing who I want to be even when I'm scared.

---

### For the Teacher

**Traditional approach:**
Solve the conflict. Assign consequences. Separate kids. "Be nice to each other."

**Why it fails:**
Kids don't learn to navigate tension—they learn to avoid getting caught.

**S.A.F.E. approach:**
Teacher facilitates, doesn't solve:
- **SEE:** "What do you notice happening? What do you feel in your body?"
- **ASK:** "What's the tension here? What are both of you needing?"
- **FEEL:** "Can both of those things be true at the same time?"
- **EMERGE:** "Who do each of you want to be in this moment?"

**Result:**
Kids develop internal capacity for conflict navigation. Teacher becomes facilitator of growth, not enforcer of rules.

## How S.A.F.E. Is Different from Traditional Programs

| **Traditional Programs** | **S.A.F.E.** |
|--------------------------|--------------|
| **Zero-tolerance policies** (punishment-based) | **Tension-holding** (learning-based) |
| **Victim/bully binary** (good kid/bad kid) | **Everyone's becoming** (we're all learning who we want to be) |
| **Adult intervention** ("Tell a teacher") | **Student agency** ("I can choose who I'm becoming") |
| **Stop the behavior** (external control) | **Build capacity** (internal formation) |
| **Rules to follow** ("Don't bully") | **Identity to form** ("Who do I want to be?") |
| **Reactive** (respond after harm happens) | **Preventive** (practice daily in all conflicts) |
| **Program to implement** (added to school day) | **Language to speak** (integrated into culture) |
